0,Aberfeldy 12-year-old  Limited Bottling Batch No.: 2905,"Very clear, tasty, smooth, rounded base release. It would be 43-46%, there would be a bomb.Pears, pies, honey pastries, peach jam, candies, piece of wood, crumbly cookies.Slightly expressed, slightly sweet with a slight acidity. A piece of wood, peaches, a basket of fresh fruit.Long, quite comprehensive for this age and price. Wood, hay, gingerbread cookie."
1,Aberfeldy 12-year-old  Limited Bottling Batch No.: 2905,"Here we have another workhorse of the blend industry, since most of Aberfeldy's production ends up as key component of Dewar's. The nose of this 12-year-old Highlander is unimposing, grainy and slightly acidic with apple cider, heather honey and hints of vinegar. On the palate, it arrives silky, light and malty sweet before turning aromatic and indistinctly sour in the development. A surprisingly milky aftertaste with almonds, muesli and a touch of oak rounds off the experience. It's probably not a very memorable Single Malt, but nice enough to give it a try.RATING: 3.0/5.0 stars ≙ 80 pts → AVERAGE"
2,Aberfeldy 12-year-old  Limited Bottling Batch No.: 2905,"Light nose: honey, sultanas, citrus and general sweetness.Taste is pretty much similar, but mainly very light.Body and development are virtually non existing. It's all very light and simple.Finish is very short with a little honey.Not a real bad whisky; there are no clear off-notes, but there's no character either. It's just a very dull and boring dram. Even for the price of 30 euro's there are way better options to consider."
3,Aberfeldy 12-year-old  Limited Bottling Batch No.: 2905,"Delicate, soft, quite sweet and fruity w/ notes of peach jam, sherry and orange zest.RATING: 83pts – |83 – 86 (B) → Good| — Not a “must”, but a nice-to-have."
4,Aberfeldy 12-year-old  Limited Bottling Batch No.: 2905,"A much overlooked whisky.Aberfeldy doesn't do a lot in terms of being unique. Refreshingly enough, the brand seems to acknowledge this. It's a highlands 12 year old whisky. It isn't terribly overprized and it's good. The nose is rather bland at first, but given time, develops a rather pleasant, albeit faint, maltish quality.Tastewise, this dram delivers quite well. Malt, honey, chocolate, a little spiciness on the back of the tongue. Aftertaste is just nice and rather warming, with nuts, milk chocolate, vanilla and honey. As stated below, not very memorable, but still a great mid-week dram, a good addition to any whisky cabinet and above all else a great introduction. This is the first dram I pick to give friends to enthuse them into exploring beyond their terrible ""i love whisky, I drink Jack Daniels all the time"" mindset."
5,Aberfeldy 12-year-old  Limited Bottling Batch No.: 2905,"Classic introductory dram, and no showpiece. Can you drink, you should perhaps better leave.Grain skimmer, honey and some citrus fruit on first nosing. Life only brings a few yellow fruits (apples and grapes) to the fore, otherwise no change. On the contrary, over time, the nose flattens out. For 40% of the alcohol is very noticeable. Warmed, the flavors are a touch of medical disinfectant in the way, even light smoke seems to be noticeable. Acetone notes in the empty glass.Integrated alcohol is something else, luck has only 40%. Very sweet honey and a bit too much oak, as well as clear alcoholic sharpness. Diluted he does not work, the mouthfeel is amazingly good, quite thick.Honey and bitter oak, rather short. What remains the longest are the anesthetized mucous membranes."

9,Aberfeldy 12-year-old  Limited Bottling Batch No.: 2905,"A good drink, especially in combination with its low cost.Sweet notes of dried grapes, dates and prunes, marshmallows.The taste is sweet, consisting of dry dark berries with a hint of oak.Medium duration, sweet."
10,Aberfeldy 18-year-old,"As for me, it is one of the top fruit single malts. Lots of fruits, no bitterness and a lot of dark chocolate, makes it a real ""TOP"" The longer it stays and breathes in the glass, the more perfect and noble the whisky becomes. Great item ... I save it to my ""shopping"" notebook under the name .... ""must be purchased""delicate, very pleasant, fruity, blackberry, vanilla, toffee, raisins, marzipansmooth, sweet, wine, vanilla ice cream, fudge, raspberries, strawberrieslong, pleasant, sweet, nutty, eventually turning into dark chocolate with a strawberry flavor"
11,Aberfeldy 18-year-old,surprisingly interesting.thanks to the blindsample I gave this one a chance. I would have never bought the whisky or a sample otherwise.unfortunately 43 % ABV

15,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,"The smoke surprises me a little. I would not have thought. The nose is complex and very beautiful. Perhaps one or two percent of alcohol would have done well in the mouth. Still, he's good.The first Aberfeldy and the 21 year old. I'm curious. The color in the snifter is a dark straw gold. Slowly thick legs form from the oily rim on the glass, which leisurely steer downwards. OK. Interesting. Perfumed soap that smells of flower meadows. I don't have any classic Sherry notes at first. The alcohol is not at all in the foreground, you can stick your nose deep into the glass and nothing burns in it. The first fruits come after the flower meadow. Red ripe apples are in the foreground, behind it is a sweetness. Now the flower meadow is moving towards the heath association, similar to what I had in my nose with the HP 12 and also a little with the Glen Garioch 12y. After the first sip, I think I have a very, very light smoke note in the nose. The orange notes appear more behind it, this could be the sherry barrel influence.Nice first oily mouthfeel. A sweetness at the beginning, the heather swings with your nose. Then comes a peppery spiciness that ends in oak. In the front of the teeth, the mouth becomes a little drier. The next sip I have the smoke here too, a balanced mouthfeel between sweetness and spiciness.The oak that I had in my mouth at the end also moves down the palate. At the very end, I feel like I notice a little smoke. Can this be? Now the second time, a delicate dark chocolate is added that lasts a little longer."
16,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,"Quite watery but fruity, sweet, very mild w/ notes of peach jam and olive oil along with ginger and grapefruit fresh.RATING: 83pts – |83 – 86 (B) → Good| — Not a “must”, but a nice-to-have."
17,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,"Orange BlossomsThe older version of the Aberfeldy 21 Year Old was matured exclusively on bourbon casks, but this more recent release – from 2014 – has some sherry matured whisky in the mix. The nose is rather closed. A get loads of barley and dark honey, but not much else. It takes a while before it shows its true colors. Hint of chewing tobacco, candied orange peel and some floral elements. Orange blossoms. There is a lovely dusty side to it though, as if I am in the attic.Unfortunately the arrival is pretty weak. The fruitiness now translates mostly into blood oranges, grapefruit and sultanas. A touch of woodspice with cinnamon and nutmeg in the lead, followed by some ginger and liquorice. Hint of chocolate and apricot marmalade. The finish is disappointingly short. It starts fairly sweet and pleasant, but quickly turns somewhat bitter.I believe this malt would fare much better at 43 or even 46% ABV. At the current strength it is all pleasant and well, but rather thin."
18,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,"Tasted together with the 12yo. Also a nice summer dram. Good to show in a Einsteigertasting with the 12er the influence of storage time. But this does not kick me unfortunately.The 21 year old smells like a logical continuation of my little brother. The honey is darker and goes towards orange blossom honey. The fruits are darker and the peach is joined by a few raisins. The flower meadow is now in full bloom and the smell heavier.Here, too, the (almost) decade helps more in the barrel. What has unfortunately remained is the wateriness. The mouth continues the impressions from the nose, no surprising new flavors. Only here comes a spiciness that I ascribe to the influence of the barrel. 3% more would certainly do him good.a bit longer than the twelve-year-old but still short. Malty and minimal astringent oak spicy."
19,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,"Pleasantly round and sweet, the alcohol is barely noticeable. Grass and floral notes. Vanilla and sweet and sour fruits.Creamy, tasty, mild, caramel and vanilla. The floral notes are repeated.Relatively short and almost liqueur-like. The sweetness remains around mouth for a whole time."
20,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,
21,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,"Seldom have the 40% destroyed a whisky so much for me, there would definitely have been a lot to gain with a few percent more. So then unfortunately any average, well drinkable, but it doesn't have to be.Lots of yellow fruit, quite sour, dried grass, some honey, overripe mango, some oak in the background joins in, rather light and creamy from the overall profile, pleasant and unspectacular, the first sip strengthens the aromas in the nose a little, which is what I find I add a little lovage, spicethe first impression is thin and rather watery, slightly sweet, here too yellow fruit paired with spicy and dry oak, mango, acid tingles in the mouth, sweetness lingers on the palate, really rarely experienced such a thin whisky, it really suffers from the 40 %, which means that the individual, very pleasant aromas are unfortunately not properly staged.Creamy, almost waxy, it becomes tart, a slight hint of grapefruit, the mouth is coated for quite a long time, although the aromas themselves don't last too long"
22,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,
23,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,"A lot of potential was wasted on this Aberfeldy. After a really nice, fruity-sweet and ripe nose, it is then much too thin on the palate, almost watery. That would definitely have needed a higher alcohol content.First a dominant orange with lots of honey. Behind it old oak. Later on, peaches, ripe pears, honeydew melon and a hint of marzipan are added to the orange.Oily and very mild with a slight sweetness. At first almost watery on the tongue, then honey, pears and vanilla. Towards the end a light peppery flavor. Overall much too thin.A light spice with soft oak wood notes and dark chocolate remains on the palate for a medium-long time."
24,Aberfeldy 21-year-old  Limited Release,
25,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Good introduction to sherried malts. Value (£25) : 8/10Classic vanilla and caramel notes. But some darker notes of sultanas as well. Much less sherried than the colour (mind the E150 added) would lead you to believe.Apples and honey. Slightly herbal as well. Some cinnamon notes before ginger spices take over.A short, spicy finish. I personally find it lacking some sweetness."
26,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"This 12-year-old Speysider appears to be the tamed version of the excellent Aberlour A'bunadh, even though it is a vatting of both ex-bourbon and ex-sherry matured whisky. Fresh, citrusy and a little bit shy at first nosing, the aroma unfolds with tropical fruits, cloves and hints of marzipan. Despite its low ABV, the taste is surprisingly strong and fruity-spicy with lots of blueberries, plums and ginger. The finish is of medium length with notes of milk chocolate, baked apple and wood tannins. An easily accessible and quite affordable Single Malt with character.RATING: 3.5/5.0 stars ≙ 83 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE"
27,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Simple but neat, quite sweet, nicely sherriedw/ notes of stewed peaches, apricot jam, honeycake with a nice nuances of caramel.RATING: 83pts – |83 – 86 (B) → Good| — Not a “must”, but a nice-to-have."
28,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Decent sensible malt for his money. I drank the bottle quickly and with pleasure.Candied peaches, apricot jam, honey pastries, pies, sweet spices, caramel and apples.Peaches, turns into apples and sweets, the nuances of cream and lush pies with chocolate chips.It echoes the taste of apple pie, various pastries and sweet spices, a slightly bitter barrel."

30,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Oaky, sherry, dried cherry,Sweet, fruity, maybe bananas, mild vanilla, more light caramel. Oak for sure. Something minty or herbal.Light and airy, vanishes and leaves behind alcohol and floral/honey notes."
31,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Decent entry-level age stated single malt.Sweet grain, bubble gum, honey, marzipan nuttiness, nutmeg, some raisins, sweet milk and slight red wine. Both the bourbon and sherry casks are noticeably present. Sweet dominates.Raspberry, redberries, lemon, pears, vanilla, sugar syrup, flat soda. The low abv is noticeable here, it shows potential but lacks flavor and viscosity.Short, orange, zesty, spicy & sweet, chocolate, a little wood shows up at the end."
32,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Tasted blind The bottle already has the new design Overall, I like the bottling, especially considering the price, there are deductions for the somewhat thin finish, here the 40% take revengeApple juice, cookies, lemon sorbet, peach, tropifrutti, no alcoholAgain tropical fruits, gummy bears, very sweet, but also an immediately somewhat spicy start in the pleasant sense, which balances out the sweetness, alcohol also reserved here As you swallow more and more, it becomes more and more spicyVanilla sugar, caramel, a touch of fruit, unfortunately (too) not very intense, but tasty"

35,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"A well put together, easily available Sherry driven whisky at good value for £30 makes this a great solid go to, a slightly more characterful than other Sherry driven whiskys (e.g. Tamnavulin).The first nosing I get the Sherry influence; some pear and orchard fruit, some candied orange rind. The more you persist the up more of the oak and vanilla from the Bourbon maturation. Packs a little more spirity punch than you’d expect from a 40%. A good but not great all rounder nose that doesn’t blow you away with complexity but has a little something for everyone depending on how hard you look for it. 78.Arrival threatens a little piquancy but quickly smooths out into a very drinkable whisky dominated by sweet caramel and hard toffee flavours. Buttery shortbread, but fresh, and the oak is prominent. Maybe a tiny hint of bitter coffee. Packs far less punch than the nose suggests, it’s very smooth but the 40% doesn’t do it any favours and an amplification up to the 46% would carry more body, oomph and also potentially some more slickness. It’s a little watery and a little ‘cleansed’ for my liking. 79Pretty short finish that tails off relatively swiftly. Again, fairly one dimensional into the caramel notes. The extra alcohol would have carried this further. 76"
36,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Red apples, plenty of honey. Fresh plums and figs, blueberries. A hint of raisins. But also vanilla. Sweet pears. Caramel and milk chocolate. Later also lemons.Sweet blackberries and plenty of honey. Raisins in the background. Vanilla. Followed by a hint of raw cashew nuts. Later some spices such as cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.Somewhat short. Vanilla. Honey. Nutmeg."
37,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"On the nose, immediately the sherry influence, with spices and dried fruits, sultanas, raisins and some fruity notes from apples and oranges.On the palate, it starts smooth, fruity, peaches, apricots, quite velvety, less sherry influence then the nose, caramel and at the end come oranges and some hints of chocolate.The finish is medium, with fruit, vanilla, chocolate and some pepper hints."

39,Aberlour 12-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Quite sweet, clearly fruity. On the one hand, light and pleasant, on the other, relatively rich for this class of whisky. Sherry aromas. Red fruit. Fresh red fruit. But there are also fruits more typical of bourbon - citrus, maybe some fresh green fruit from the orchard. Caramel. Red apples. The second time is chocolate and milk.Pretty sweet. Pretty full and rich. Fresh fruit. Later red fruit. Some spices. Some sherry comes in. More and more. Dessert chocolate appears. Nuts. The second time there is some oak and cocoa.Dessert chocolate, even more than on the tongue. A pinch of spices. Definitely chocolate and cocoa. Less fruit than on the nose or tongue.

57,Aberlour 16-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"A pleasant fruity-spicy-elegant ""dessert whisky"" in its prime.The nose of the Aberlour is very inviting with its fresh baked flavors, the light fruitiness (especially light grapes) and some sherry; In the background also some oak spice appears.Very clearly comes the Aberlour in the mouth, a beautiful spicy fruitiness (again with the light grapes) determines the scene. Also on the palate are some darker fruits and oak.The oak determines with a few herbs and some sherry the medium-long finish."

59,Aberlour 16-year-old  Double Cask Matured,"Wow, this one took me for a pleasant surprise in a blind tasting. Came on the tongue rather harmless and less intense than the nose suggested. But after only a couple of sips, it established itself as a malt that's got more to offer than the low abv. would make you believe. It really grew on me as a very sippable and pleasant malt. Aberlour sherry bomb? Nope. Inexpensive for what it is? Meh, maybe but for the price I'd love to get 43% abv. minimum, actually. The only other detriment is a flawed finish with a very slight soap note."

He is a bit cautious when it comes to releasing his aromas - this may be due to the ""only"" 40% alcohol content. It would be interesting how the 43 variant is in this regard.Color is amber. Fruity and sweet, initially oranges, then ripe red apples. Rum raisins and caramel.Soft body, gentle. Creamy mouthfeel. Milk chocolate, fear from the nose. Changes to spiciness with cinnamon and nutmeg. A bit watery on the whole.Soft finish. Subtle notes of sherry. Subtle oak. Becomes drier towards the end. Finish rather medium-long."

A certain sweetness is recognizable. The wood comes through too. A delicate aroma, unfortunately not very intense.A relatively cask-accented malt. You notice the double maturation. However, there can't have been many first-fill casks on either side... A little more of everything would be great.Short to medium length. Rather on the sherry side. The alcohol burns a little.

80,Allt-a-Bhainne Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Allt a Bhainne 40%. Official bottling. Dark yellow with a soft orange hue. Aroma is bubblegummy, ever so slightly feinty maybe - slight suggestions of cheese and plastic. But mostly quite airy. Touch of sawdust. Not much to it. Taste is light, watery, very soft, incredibly light and inoffensive, slightly papery, very little of the advertised peat up front though it does build. You'd have to drink a lot to get a dose of peat though. I mean it tastes fine. Good drinkability, no alcohol shows up. Maybe a bit like a half decent blend. If I had a BSW that tasted like this I would be fairly satisfied, and blind I wouldn't have it down as a malt. Not a bad whisky, but it's hard to know who it's aimed at really."

86,Allt-a-Bhainne Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"If this is a distillery bottling then I would stick to the IB's. It's not totally crap, just very boring. This was a sample courtesy of my Polish neighbour.A soft fruity nose, Victoria plum, peach, red apple and green melon. There is also some sort of candy note like marshmallow. I am finding it quite pleasant, a nice sniffer. It says on the bottle, just enough peat to start a fire, I couldn't find a trace.The soft fruity notes continue with the taste and I'm afraid that's about it. You are waiting for something else to arrive and it never does, it just bypasses straight to the finish.The finish isn't much to right home about either, short and sweet."

Just a wonderful, sweet and nutty, fruity whisky that's shockingly different from the regular Amrut Classic Indian Single Malt Review.PALATE: Waxy banana, malt, orchard fruit, melon rind, herbal pine, vanilla, pistachios, golden raisins, oak, baking spice and a touch of black licorice. The palate of the XXX is so much more powerful and decadent with an oaky pop that starts light but grows. This is nice.FINISH: Long -> Waxy banana, oak, spice and, herbal pine and pistachio gelato mix into one of my favorite fades in recent whisky memory."

96,Ardbeg An Oa,"Not bad, not bad at all. Much better - but probably a bit higher priced - than the 'Select' or 'Small Batch' releases of other renowned Islay distilleries.Amazingly fresh and fruity in the nose. Lime cream. Maybe sweetened with a little honey. The smoke I feel noticeably less phenolic and less ""dirty"" and tarry, as in TEN, Uigeadail or even at various UAs, which I was allowed to taste in recent months. I have an interesting tobacco association. It will be interesting to see how the clear smoke affects the taste.46.6% ABV already suspect it. The drinking strength makes the malt look very pleasant on the tongue. The beautiful citrus note, which reminds me of some of the long-gone Ardbeg distillates, remains intact. The AN OA looks pleasantly creamy, but without being able to match the almost proverbial creaminess of a Port Charlotte in this aspect. The 'smelt' reminiscent of chocolate pralines. Only from the mouth feeling, even if I have no present Schokonoten in the taste. The sweetie has deposited the honey and seems to me now rather malty. Vanilla powder like a pudding. Interesting spice, cereal notes. Oatmeal, soaked barley, in addition to the nose now stronger smoke flavors. The smoke is quite maritime, but much less tarry and medically, as one is used to from the bottlings of recent years, what the AN OA a great clarity, I would almost say 'purity' provides, which I like personally. If there is a summer whisky from Ardbeg, the rather unconvincing Blasda times out, then it is the AN OA.No miss notes! No sulfur, no metal, although by nature he is certainly still young, and above all no excessive bitterness. So for me more balanced than the Kelpie, which scores in the nose with great smoke and eucalyptus and in the finish then goes under the bitter load of the Black Sea areas in the knee. But back to AN OA. The previously rather lemony smoke exchanges its fruitiness towards the end in slightly earthy notes that remind me quite remotely to the Ardbog and form a nice, round conclusion."
97,Ardbeg An Oa,"[October, 2017]  I call this the ""little Kelpie"".  Obviously, Kelpie was a test ballot on how a caucasian virgin oak Ardbeg is received by the Ardbeg community.  And as the reactions on the Kelpie were rather mixed they most probably adjusted the An Oa recipe to a more smoother and less woody (aggressive) dram by adding more standard bourbon casks and less virgin oak - what is fine.But why do they use virgin caucasian oak at all?  The reason is very simple:  Due to the long-lasting whisky boom there is a severe cask shortage at all Scottish distilleries (bourbon whisky did not grow as much as Scotch did) and even more severe at groups that do not own a bourbon distiillery in their portfolio (like LVHM).  Consequently, to mature the ever growing output scottish distilleries more and more have to use virgin oak casks too and therefore a lot of scotch whisky has become more wood-driven and bourbon-ish in their style (look at Laphroaig or Macallan, for example).  Caucasian oak induces a different flavours profile into whisky than the traditional american or european oak.  It is significantly more herbal with eucalyptus and camphor notes (that I personally do not like as this reminds me of cough medicine).  In this respect it is a completely new style of whisky that you either like or not.  But to say it very clear:  Distilleries do this out of despair (as they are short of high quality casks) and not because they want to innovate...  But it is an innovation, nevertheless!  And we will see if this leads to some more interesting flavour profiles over time (once the maturation had a chance to really work over an appropriate period and not just for a few years as with the Kelpie or An Oa), especially when second and third fill caucasian casks are available.But to be honest:  This is a typical Ardbeg, for sure and it is better than other standard editions right now (good that they did the test ballot with the Kelpie).  But it is not great and rather average only (or judged by Ardbeg standards:  still below average)...PS:  I tried batch L67986 bottled 04/07/2017."
98,Ardbeg An Oa,"As an addition to the core range thought, you can sort it well as a beginner Ardbeg.Cool, phenolic smoke over lemon cake and lime slices. Maritime notes of seaweed, algae and sun-dried fish. Saline, spices come from afar. Over time dried apricots, later also red grapes. Long smoky.Lemon smoke with tobacco crumbles bounces on the tongue. Nice dry, ashy. Fine salt note, mild herbs, ginger, fine-sour chocolate. Becomes a bit bitter over time, but does not lose strength.Medium long, dry, smoky, with hints of roasted lemon slices."
99,Ardbeg An Oa,"Quick hit review.Let's call it the 'Tiny Beastie', as this bottling became more or less obsolete with Ardbeg's release of Wee Beastie. Vegetal peat smoke, brine and vanilla characterize both nose and palate, the old theme of sweetness and peat that can't go wrong. Smoked bacon, orange zest and mild pepper fade in the medium finish. A simple and yet enjoyable dram, but if in doubt, I would always go for Wee Beastie.RATING: 3.5/5.0 stars ≙ 84 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE"
100,Ardbeg An Oa,"The aroma, which is not typical for Ardbeg, contains dark chocolate, lemon zest and tobacco. The taste is slightly peaty with hints of dried bananas and spices. The finish is medium, peppery-chocolate, aniseed. Quite an unexpected profile, which you cannot blindly give to Ardbeg, mineral-chocolate, slightly fruity, not bad. RATING: 85pts - | 83 - 86 (B) → Good | - Not a “must”, but a nice-to-have."
101,Ardbeg An Oa,"(Tasted semi-blind; I knew it was Ardbeg, not which one)NOSE: Sweet bonfire ashes. Initially it smells like a relativelely dry, not so coastal peat, which has had a healthy dose of sherry maturation. Gradually a maritime influence comes along, with iodine, tar, old tarry boat ropes, some herbal greens, winter green, and that sweet oily smell which you get from combining Islay peated spirit with sherry casks. Quite rich and lovely but not terribly complex. With time becomes more and more green and herbal. (88-89p).TASTE: The arrival is rather fruity and slightly sweet. On the mid palate there are greengages, green bananas and green herbs, with eucaluptys and mint and also some bitter green herbs as well as some bitter wood tannins. (86p).EXIT: Sweet, slightly oily bonfire ashes. Mild black pepper. Green herbs. Quite nice. (86p).OVERALL: A very green and herbal, but a bit unbalanced. A not so very ardbeggy Ardbeg. Lovely nose, though. TOTAL SCORE 87 (86) points."
102,Ardbeg An Oa,"Nice Ardbeg, but certainly no improvement over the Ten, Corryvreckan or Uigeadail for me.Typical heavy but fresh Ardbeggian peat. Lemon, aniseed, chalky, sea spray, ropes and tar. Quite familiar, but I also get dates and banana.Dry peat with sour citrus notes. Fresh herbs (peppermint,cumin), artificial sweetness, a bit grassy and waxy.More restrained peat, quite mineral and a bizarre fizzy feeling of 7-up. Some milk chocolate and fades out dry."
103,Ardbeg An Oa,"It's a bit the tamed version of the Ten, I did not notice so much of the sherry influence, but a good complement of the standard range, which I would pour in now and then, if I did not have hundreds of samples in front of me ;-)Beautiful phenolic smoke, somehow I have the feeling of sitting in a pine forest, spicy, but also fresh, grated lemon peel, greasy, under it slightly leathery, the Ardbegsüße is also there, but not as superficial as the Ten, the existing fruit note is more in Direction yellow fruits, right sherry associations I have now in the nose no, after the first sip even fresher, more citrus, lightercreamy, directly a lot of smoke, here now relatively sweet, greasy, some cinnamon, pepper, syrupy, honey, yellow fruit, vanilla, slightly chalky, the mouthfeel itself is quite dry, if you smack something is the bacon also something milk chocolate to guess , quite creamy, delicious but also quite simpledry, the ashy and spicy smoke dominates here, fruit on the palate, otherwise the mouth is still full of smoke with a light citrus note"

105,Ardbeg An Oa,"Nose: loads of fresh lemon, lemon peel, lemon drop sweets (Napoleon lemon balls), lemon curd, bitter oranges and lime which actually overpower the smoke and peatiness at first glance. Also there's some pencil shavings and a touch of milk chocolate.Taste: quite similar to the nose but a little less profound, clear citrus with again the lemon curd and sweets, spicy peatiness and the fresh wood notes.The finish is of medium length with smoked wood and has a honied lemony sweet/sour feel to it.Less smokey and peaty than expected on beforehand, but I really like the fresh lemony feel of this dram. I might even prefer this over the 10 year old.Edit: as the bottle level drops, the citrus notes shift more and more to the background. The ashy notes in the finish get more pronounced. It turns out to be a bit of a one trick pony, which does not improve with time. I'm dropping the score, still a decent enough dram though."
106,Ardbeg Corryvreckan,"[March, 2017]  Another Ardbeg re-taste:  When the first Corryvreckan was released I found it not just a very interesting dram with a new, never before tasted profile (due to its share of virgin oak matured malt) but it became my favourite modern Ardbeg too.  And I scored it 88 points.Today I tried a recent bottling of the Corryvreckan and - what a disappointment:  It is rather unbalanced and with a slightly drying/bitter finish (not as extreme as with the recent TEN or Uigeadail, but still unpleasant).  I guess Ardbeg increased the share of virgin oak matured spirit in this recipe significantly and this higher proportion of heavy tannins (and lower share of sweet bourbon flavours) harm not just the balance but the mouthfeel too.This is most probably due to the problem that LVHM has difficulties in sourcing enough bourbon casks from the US.  The Scotch whisky boom came at a time when the US whisky industry was in deep recession - so the Scotch demand for used bourbon casks was and still is much higher than the US distilleries can supply. As a consequence the Scottish distilleries cut down the maturation times to use the same cask more often (and mask this by introducing NAS whiskies) AND (as this was not enough) they had to use virgin oak casks in addition.  For sure they market this as an intentional strategy, nevertheless it is pure despair.  But what can you do if you do not have enough good quality casks at your hands?The outcome is devastating (at least to my taste buds) but hopefully they create a new followership among all the new whisky aficionados that do not know how good Ardbeg and all the other great drams once tasted (without heavy tannins)..."

108,Ardbeg Corryvreckan,"Ardbeg - and the hype goes on! Named after a whirlpool north of Jura, Corryvreckan is a NAS core range expression with cracking 57.1% ABV. With its combination of candy floss, orange zest and delicate BBQ peat smoke, the nose starts out promising. On the palate, the dry and spicy arrival is entirely dominated by French oak, followed by a blast of briny peatiness. Unpleasantly bitter herbs and grapefruit creep in, culminating in a peppery-dry finish which is medium at best.

The combination is just incredible, it works out very well, its full flavor is very enjoyable if you like peaty/smoky stuff. Since then it became one of my favorite bottles for a reasonable price.I also have to admit that the current/newest bottle seems to be a bit different than the older version I had about 4 years ago, but maybe I have changed too much meanwhile and my palate evolved with trying some other beautiful drams. Anyway, it's still a solid thing to go for!"
114,Ardbeg Corryvreckan,"I actually prefer this one over the basic Ardbeg Ten (I rate that one higher because of its price/performance ratio). And I do firmly believe, that there are some older whiskies in the bottle. Yet it should be slightly cheaper. And again those fresh oak notes might be off-putting to some people. A combination of sherry and peat (like you have it in Uigeadail) is much more pleasant to a wider audience. I preffer Corryvreckan anyday though. Its truly a whirpool of tase. Those 57,1 % of alcohol make it even better.Peat, caraway.Very smoky and ashy. Surprisingly pleasant (nearly no alcohol burn). Bitter, spicy and woody from the fresh oak barrels (many people dislike this). It feels a bit like sawdust on your tongue.Caraway stays. Warm and pleasant."

129,Ardbeg Uigeadail,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deHeavy smoke (campfire, ash and tar) and a light ocean breeze take over the command immediately. The aromatic intensity is always impressive. The high alcohol content (54.2%) initially stings slightly in the nose. After about 30 minutes breathing the nosing is more pleasing. Sweet fruit notes penetrate the dominant smoke after a few minutes. Vanilla, salty caramel sweets, lemon rub, hints of red fruit, tobacco and freshly ground pepper follow. The longer the malt can breathe, the more harmonious and pleasant the nose becomes.Welcome to Islay! At the first sip, a ruthless pepperiness for a moment maltreats my tongue tip, while my entire mouth is flooded with sweet smoke. The wonderful smoke is a powerful mixture of campfire, tar and a little bit of ash. The texture is pleasantly oily, near creamy / buttery. The alcohol is better integrated for my feeling than was the case with the Nosing. The sweet fruit flavors are now gaining more and more strength and refine the taste experience with beautiful vanilla notes and salty caramel. Red fruits, oranges, lemon rubbed, dark chocolate, hints of nuts and plenty of herbs and oak follow. Intensive, multi-layered and well-balanced.Long, smoky-sweet and warm. Furthermore, it smokes on all corners and ends, fresh fruits and a nice residual sweetness accompany the finish. Grapefruit (slightly acidic impact), lemons, vanilla and dark chocolate are present. Herbs and spicy oak provide a minimal bitter and dry finish on the palate."
130,Ardbeg Uigeadail,"First impression / color / viscosity:  Yes, a classic - only the packaging and marketing Blah blah on it enchant me. Of course, the first impression is due to the smoke.  Color: saffron / viscosity: very oily run-off  Aroma / Nose feeling:  Pleasant feeling at the first Verriechen, only light alcoholic stinging (passes). Pleasant smoke that reminds me of a burnt camp fire. Such a campfire on which you sat all night and the next morning even smells like the ashes. Slightly grassy and already very sweet when I smelt, I would also describe the malt. Over time, caramelized lemon peels that blend in harmoniously.  Taste / mouthfeel:  This sweetness, this freshness, this citrus note - I just love it. At the beginning, the scotch tingles on the tip of the tongue and the oak turns the pepper mill on the inside of the cheeks. As a result, I notice the stunningly chocolaty, creamy mouthfeel with the ubiquitous smoke and superbly incorporated alcohol. With water, the single malt is a perfect treat. Round and sweet, slightly spicy with green wood, vanilla and nut cream. In addition, unripe peach and green grapes and their seeds.  Except for the Octomore OBA I could not find this purity, balance and perfection in any other smoker (heavily peated, without majority ex-Sherry Fassreifung). Sure, there are plenty of other good smokers but as here, in the way no one else came into the glass.  Finish / aftertaste / Length:  A long, sweet finish, which is characterized by the pleasant smoke. The finish also reflects floral and especially refreshing aromas. The Nachschmecken is minimal bitter and a bit sour. I feel like spending a long evening in a smoky bar.  Overall impression / comment:  I have to admit that I'm not objective here - I just love this malt and all the trappings around it. I even like the progressive marketing of Ardbeg, as it obviously is marketing and I do not have to feel kidding as a customer (in contrast, I hate ""back-end marketing"").  Well at least regarding flavors / taste: For me (!) This is the best single malt Scotch, which is constantly available and still priced in the (subjectively) affordable framework holds. At least from those I've tasted so far ...  Points:  95/100; By the way, the original from 2003 (bottled) got one more point with me ..."

Pity!Wonderfully peaty and smoky, coal smoke, grill flavors, burned grass and espresso. With water: filigree, burned oak, a trace of vanilla, burnt fruit, rose and lavender soap, swimming pool and bandages.Oily and soft in the body. Powerful start with lots of smoke and peat. With water sweeter and floral. Here more burnt herbs and also resinous flavors. Juniper?Long, powerful, sweet and invigorating."
136,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"A young, typical and really convincing Ardbeg. The ""Wee Beastie"" is amazingly round and harmonious despite its tender age. Powerful, oily and creamy on the palate with a nice sequence of flavours typical of Islay as well as sweet and fruity accents. Really drinkable - even after adding a few drops of water: nothing dominates, nothing imposes itself. An all-day dram! I thank Moët Hennessy Germany for the complimentary sample!https://www.whisky-connaisseur.de/2020/04/01/ardbeg-5yo-wee-beastie/A sweet start on the nose, followed by meaty flavours, BBQ and a good deal of peat smoke. Herbal notes spread, along with pine resin, black pepper and warming wood fire. Over time, sweet again as well as fruity with orange oil and creamy vanilla.Powerful start on the palate. Oily, then peppery and warming. Tar oil, aniseed and cloves dominate at first, before sweet notes of vanilla and milk chocolate appear. The sweetness fades away with fine peat smoke towards the finish.The finish is medium long, oily, spicy and slightly warm with subtle notes of tar, peat, smoke, pepper and a little dry oak. Salty caramel has a pleasant aftertaste. With water: By adding a few drops of water, this young Ardbeg becomes stronger and somehow more pungent on the nose with more peat smoke, but also a bit more vanilla sweetness. Prickling and slightly peppery on the palate. Less warming with a touch of peat smoke, but clearly more vanilla sweetness and orange fruit. The finish is of medium length, oily and a bit herbal with fine smoke and some tar oil."
137,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"Definitely nice, 85/86. At 40 euros a good purchase. Better than the An Oa. It can't compete with the Ten which is more integrated, unless you prefer a clear first fill bourbon influence. Perhaps not a completely fair comparison as the Ten I have open is from a few years ago.Peat, apple, vanilla, caramel and a bit of banana.Peat, apple, wood spice, vanilla, peach and lime.Peat, apple, peach, caramel, vanilla and spice."
138,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"A 'Monster of a Dram' promised us the outgoing Mickey Heads, it should be a real tongue tingler, Dr Bill lets us know. Wow, plenty of laurels!  EYE / NOSE  The beastie looks pale golden in the nosing glass. The malt has now reached the optimum drinking temperature and the glass has a strong, tar-like smoke note, behind it a little vanilla. I arm myself, because the nose, if not particularly complex, promises a violent rush on the taste buds.  PALATE  Surprise ... the malt has a pleasantly creamy, warm mouthfeel and looks far less powerful than would have been expected after the very strong nose. The nice thing is, metallic bad notes or similar 'youth sins' are inapplicable despite the young years here. However, I don't feel a strong tingling on the tongue. Smoke and tar dominate the taste. The sweetness from the nose is retained, now looks a bit more herbaceous, which is good for the beastie. However, what I lack a bit, even after several rehearsals, are the fruit notes typical of the Ardge region - citrus aromas, for example, which mostly shape the taste profile and perfectly complement the typical smoke. The finesse comes a little short for my taste, due to the lack of complexity.  FINISH / CONCLUSION  Not particularly long for a young Islay. The tar flavors lie on the tongue, there remains a slightly peppery sharpness and an oily mouthfeel, as well as a dry bitterness that increases with the sips. Further water does not help him, at best it makes him less spectacular because it begins to appear watery.  All-in-all not a bad dram, especially since the beastie has no bad notes. He honestly didn't really convince me, because he's just a little monster. I had hoped for it more wildly, impetuously, the powerful, 'factory' water addition washed the young savage a little (too) soft for my taste.  More notes and reviews on Facebook at: #Maltkanzlei"
139,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"Hey Seashepherd, Ardbeg has killed too many dolphins this year? Seriously? Giving 1 to the wee beastie as well as to the blaaack is just pathetic. Are you confined to one of the Faroe Islands? Were you forced to eat a porpoise steak with Ardbeg sauce?"
140,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"Ardbeg with a “5” on the label did not exist yet. Ardbeg certainly did not reinvent the wheel of young Islay smokers - they also followed a similar path with the Very and Still Young NAS whiskys.  The proportion of older barrels will not be that high, with its pear notes and green branch aromas it brings its youth into your nose, on your tongue and in the finish. You get what you can expect. No more, no less.A note of smoked pear wedges and pepper, warm apple sauce and strong peat smoke. Anything but shy, rather jostling and straight out. Milk chocolate, more pepper. The youthful pear note weakens over time, is replaced by lime juice and green branches.Quite strong start with a full load of dry smoke (brand: ashtray overflowing with tipped out), lime juice. Clearly phenolic, warm tar, a little Hansaplast, reminiscent of another south coast distillery. Pear here too, green branches, fresh grass clippings, bitter herbs, hot pepper. Freshly ground coffee beans. Sizzles on the tongue.The smoke stays for a long, very long time, but since the other aromas - except for a few last young birch branches and one or the other pear note - have quickly thinned out, one should speak of a short finish here."
141,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"Quick hit review.I'm not a huge Ardbeg fan, but this youngster was decent enough to write a review. Earthy and mineral notes hit the nose, almost like a horse stable. The peat is gentle, enriched by pears, white pepper and a touch of Parmesan. On the palate, vanilla and honey are first to arrive, followed by menthol, kippers and lemon zest. Leafy peat smoke, herbs and hints of brine migrate into the medium finish. This malt is better than I expected!RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"
142,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"The Ardbeg Wee Beastie is a welcome addition to the core range.Sweet fruits (overripe bananas come to mind), vegetal peat smoke and hints of cracked black peppercorns. A whisper of resin, licorice and star anise as well.Thick and oily and surprisingly gentle for such a young Ardbeg. It's a peat bomb for sure, but then again, it isn't? Powerful and rich, yet restraint. Sorry, I'm not making much sense. Peaty, peppery, ashy, but also freshly cut grass and menthol. A satisfying sweetness underneath it all, highlighted by caramelised bacon.Lingering spices, soft touches of cinnamon. Medium to long."
143,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2020/04/22/outside-the-box-from-armagnac-to-ardbeg/If this had been an annual release accompanied with all the bells n whistles marketing flannel and a bumped-up price tag, I’d have ignored it. But it’s affordable, available [in Europe but not the UK yet ?!?], and its got an age statement. ‘Brave’, some say. I agree, and yet 5yo whisky has been around for decades. A common sight on the whisky landscape of the 1960s-80s, Scotch with a 5yo age statement was a regular feature for distilleries such as Auchentoshan, Balblair, Caperdonich, Glenburgie, Glenesk, Glenfarclas, Glen Flager, Glen Grant, Glen Moray, Glen Scotia, Tomatin, Tullibardine,…. and many others. Modern examples include Bunnahabhain [Staoisha], Octomore [05.1], Gelston’s, Hinch, Akashi,… Whisky with a 5yo age statement isn’t a new manoeuvre. We’ve just had to endure a number of heavy marketing/NAS/anti-disclosure years to get back to where we were.So how is the Ardbeg? Very pleasing. This smells and tastes like the ingredients its made of – toasted malted barley and sweet vegetal peat smoke. All good so far.And the ‘wee’ [47.4%] punch? I find it decidedly relaxed. Also, there is no neck pour issue, but again, we are outdoors which must be having quite an effect.The form is measured and overall, it’s clean but not clinical.C: Another good move from Ardbeg. Really impressed with this wee 5yo. I don’t think peeps will be disappointed.[Provisionally scores 85 poitns]"
144,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"Thanks to kfhakan for the sample.I've been truly disappointed by the latest cask experiments and Ardbeg-Day releases of late, so Lord and behold, this is the best ""new"" Ardbeg I have tasted in a long time.There's no hiding that this is rather young, but then it says so right on the label. Thanks Ardbeg!.As such it is not particularly complex, but it holds what you expect from a young Islay in generous measures.Sweet peat, licorice, smoked meat.It lays down the grounds for great expectations in taste.Not quite the Beast expected by the nose, but it doesn't disappoint.It arrives peppery and spicy. The 47,4% is perfect in carrying the bold flavours.Simple but rich with a nice thick mouthfeel.Peat, tar, dark bitter chocolate.There's no drop off, the spice and peat just fades slowly in a long finish.This is good whisky at a good price."
145,Ardbeg Wee Beastie,"Dear whisky friends, the shop links that come with this bottle probably do not have this bottle code, there are three other variants."
146,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,"More on: https://tomtrinkt.blog/First Association: Schwartau Extra Strawberry Vanilla! Very dominant fruity, especially strawberries, raspberries and cherries stand out. Vanilla / caramel, some honey, juicy oranges and already slightly spicy oak notes are noticeable. In the background there is always a pleasant camp fire smoke.Sweet, creamy and oily. Dark fruits with a slightly acidic impact are quickly gaining dominance. The 46% by volume are very well integrated and give the drop the necessary power. More strawberries, raspberries, a few red apples, forest honey and the first spicy notes of the 12-year-old whisky are noticeable. In the background, a fine campfire smoke envelops all flavors without ever becoming too dominant. Some bittersweet chocolate is already added.Medium long, slightly smoky, the fruit notes give way to a noticeable oak spiciness. Again some dark chocolate and getting drier. All in all, very harmonious!"
147,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,"Price / performance killer. Amazingly complex in the nose for his age and otherwise just delicious and tasty.Soft smoke and some citrus fruit right from the start, berry fruits add to the bouquet in a very short time and the smoky notes are not only clearer but also more defined. A nice little fire is burning, on which the berries are roasted. After a little more time, some iodine, furniture polish, disinfectants and bacon are added, all very discreet. Mineral notes and fruit panna cotta complete the impression with some fennel and mint. The whole thing is warmed up a little sweeter and heavier, the sour notes for the first time become really clear and enhance the impression of fruity berries. Much more complex than expected, and quite appetizing ...Very soft on the go with very slow power delivery. The mouthfeel is quite fluid. First, sweet and sour parts are in the mouth together and also support the impression of fresh berry fruit, perhaps in honey. Very late, notes of dark chocolate appear and give first indications that he is already 12 years old.The finish is clean, and if it were not for the peaty parts, it would be very short. It sounds pretty chunky fast and leaves a nice, smoky memory on the tongue."
148,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,"Complex and very round, nice sweetness and subtle smoke. Excellent PLV.Pleasant smoke combined with slight sweetness. Spicy, light fruit. Alcohol is not felt.Smoke, spicy pepper. Fruity sweet, very complex and harmonious. Drying.Very fruity, long. Seasoning and light smoke."
149,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,"[November, 2015]  I emptied a bottle together with friends that I bought for 49 Euros in October, 2015.  In my old rating system (ten scales that translate into WB points: 50 - 66 - 75 - 80 - 82,5 - 85 - 87,5 - 90 - 92,5 - 95) I scored it 85.  My notes state an easy-to-drink and enjoyable dram without any special characteristics.  The port finish is recognisable but not dominant at all.  Quaffable..."
150,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,"Was a birthday present. And what can I say ... delicious, tasty, good!Hm ... I'll say so. The colleague smells like standing in a bed of fresh, red fruits. Fruity and light to earth. The neighbor has the grill on and the smoke pulls you into the bed. Spear of charcoal smoke and subtly fleshy.Slightly spicy onset. The immediately goes into a creamy fruit sweetness. The colleague tastes like he smells. Pleasant oak flavor with a trace, smoke comes to and around 'the story' beautiful. Tasty, tasty.Some bitter, smoked nut chocolate. Slightly dry. Nevertheless, the fresh fruit sweetness remains medium."
151,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,
152,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,"Similar in character to Talisker Port Ruighe as both the port influence and the phenol levels are concerned. The Ardmore smoke is less coastal / salty and more herbal / earthy, though. A sweet and winey nose. Some creamy vanilla and a hefty helping of fruity esters combine to create an impression of raspberries and strawberries in yoghurt. Behind (or on top, or to the side of, depending on your favorite locational metaphor) that there are damp autumnal forest floors, smoked cheese (Scamorza, anyone?), some serious umami (soy sauce, Marmite) and bonfire embers. With time, a leathery, nutty sensation comes up as well, almost as in a sherry-matured whisky. Nice nose altogether!In the mouth, the sense of fruit yoghurt continues. Taste is sweet all the way though, even when the sweetness is joined by some peppery oak in the finish. Speaking of the finish, it's... let's say ""extended"" rather than long. This is due primarily to the peated malt; I don't find that the casks do a lot of work here. Sadly, the fruity sweetness leaves an impression of artificial sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin, and the like) after it has died down, which subtracts from the experience.To my mind, the combination of vegetal, herbal notes and sweet fruity aromas clashes rather than meshes, at least on the tongue. The initially mentioned Talisker & Port combo is a better fit in this regards. That being said, this is still quality stuff, properly aged, with a good-to-very-good nose and a decent ABV. I'm just not enthusiastic about the port influence on the palate."
153,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,"Ardmore 12 It's actually already a classic, this Ardmore 12. Its strawberry-vanilla aroma in particular precedes its reputation. Anyone who deals with whisky cannot avoid a glass. Great PLV. An extra point for that! N - In the first nose the smoke still pierces strongly. If you let the whisky linger briefly in the glass, the well-known strawberry-vanilla note immediately rises to the nose. Raspberries and cherries wrapped in pleasant smoke. Creamy, buttery texture. Behind it hides some wine gums. M - Fruity, relaxed attack, generally a bit more reserved than the nose would suggest. Alcohol is very well integrated. Beautiful raspberries with pepper, a sweet and sour berry mix. Departure slightly woody-bitter, pleasantly smoky and not overpowering. The campfire glows on the tongue for a few minutes."

155,Ardmore 12-year-old  Port Wood Finish,"What a delight! Ardmore combined with sherry casks is a perfect couple but this one proves that Port casks also can deliver.A sweet and rather heavy nose. The 46% abv seems to be working quite perfect here. Usual suspects with figs, dried plumbs and sultana’s but it’s being complimented with a really earthy kind of peat smoke and charcoal. This is what I often get with Ardmore. It’s a completely different style of peat then Islay for instance. Also whiffs of star anise and black tea.Soft, sweet, creamy and with dried spices. Good body. Again I get flavors of tea and also it seems to have quite some tannins. It’s making this whisky a bit dry. For me it’s within the limits but I can imagine people tend this to be a bit too dry. Tastewise this one can handle a drop or two of water.Medium length finish. Again sweet but with a beautiful amount of smoke/peatsmoke. It gives a bit of a coastal experience combined with smoked veggies and mildly smoked meat.An absolute buy recommendation for around 40-50 bucks. BFYB? Quite personal but for me: yep!"
156,Ardmore 1996,"Smoke? Yes, yes, but not in your face, and firstly, the interplay with the fruitiness is superbly balanced and secondly, the alcohol is impressively well integrated, so that you only notice a slight tingle at the tip of the tongue.  Certainly, this malt is not dominated by Islay barrels, even if they are palpable.  Very nicely done!Fruity-aromatic smoke, smoldering mossy oak log, interwoven fruit components, apricot dumplings, a little eucalyptus or tea tree oilIn the mouth completely supple-oily, I would like to go back and forth for hours, but spice: licorice on the campfire with a little pepper, despite spicy but also sweet in the direction of dark forest honey.Significantly juicy wood and distant light ashy notes, a Katenschinkenaroma remains long on the tongue, at the same time swing again and again old oranges and lemons over the fence, and again smoked fish to taste, but the reverberation remains harmonious and still long Mundwässernd."
157,Ardmore 1996,"Want a lot of time in the glass - is getting better - subtle beautysweet oily oak with a hint of smoke, sour, cinnamon, cracked sugar, nutmeg, licorice, mint. oily fat, give me more time in the glass - luscious vanillasweet with pricklendem smoke, sweetness, mint, anise, blossoms, licorice, full-bodied, nutritious, ripe and round without being weak, peppery oak - beautiful complexity - but he scores more with his cultivated intensity than with high complexityCitrus, oily, mint, chocolate with nuts"
158,Ardmore 1996,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deThe 20-year-old Ardmore reveals his pleasant and complex profile immediately after pouring. My first impression is dominated by sweet, bright fruits, gentle notes of wood and subtle smoke. More precise: Ripe apples, orange peel, tangerines, figs, hints of exotic fruits (peaches & far away hides a gentle connotation of honeydew melons), vanilla, fresh tobacco leaves, some leather, spicy oak notes and campfire smoke. The alcohol (49.3%) is not noticeable and perfectly integrated.Pleasantly oily, almost creamy, the malt wets my entire oral cavity and stimulates salivation. Again, the perfectly integrated alcohol convinced. The sweet, light fruits soon start to crave for the upper edge of the taste, especially with candied candied exotic fruits, figs and tangerines are present again. After a few moments, the ""heavy"" notes pick up speed: fresh tobacco leaves, leather, various spices, dark chocolate and dry campfire smoke pave the way for the taste in the direction of the finish. Well balanced with an interesting aroma constellation.Medium long, powerful and smokier. The sweet, bright fruits give a strong exclamation point at the beginning of the finish, before gradually fading. In the background, a dry, spicy-smoky conglomerate gradually builds up, which sets the tone after a few moments. Spicy oak, leather, campfire smoke and a noticeable dryness on the palate remain."
159,Ardmore 1996,"Tasting Notes:  Nose: It is clear from the start that this is not a trivial standard malt that is interchangeable in its aroma or to be confused with others. And even this typical modern sound of many other whiskys today seems to be missing. Jippiehh, a character drops! And that's it, shows an interesting combination of straw, pepper, malt, mint, lemon balm, yes, also some vanilla (but is the only modern!) And a wonderfully fine peat note, which is clearly present but well integrated. A complex mix of apples, pears, grapefruit and grapes will come in after a while, as well as earthy impressions and nut nougat cream.  Mouth: Powerful, clearly citrusy, again with straw, earth and well integrated smoke. Slightly salty, nutty, rather dry and slender, but intense and elegant. As in the aroma, it is also on the tongue wonderfully unfashionable, almost a little understated, balanced and yet enormously present, with a great mixture of fine smoke, fruit, earthy notes, peppery pungency and subtle vanilla sweetness.  Finish: Dry, but somewhat dull, plant-like and ashen.  Conclusion: I like Ardmore, and so I like this one so much that I have bought a whole box of it to be able to enjoy this drop in the future. Too bad that he drops something in the finish, but until then optimal! Amazingly complex nose!  https://whiskycuse.wordpress.com/"
160,Ardmore 1996,"Few can cope with the delicate bitter notes. But if you are interested in it (especially in the finish), you've come to the right place. A very special malt. I like him. Only the wonderfully fruity drops noticeably on the palate, which remains below 88.Nice smoke at the beginning and immediately afterwards a harmoniously fruity orgy. Marzipan potatoes filled with orange jam. Caramel candy with a citrus flavor. I hope this is how the main part and the finale would turn out. Unfortunately, no.Mineral light smoke at the beginning with rather sour-salty-sweet fruits. Therefore very complex. Good barrel choice. Masterpiece. Now the smoke gets even stronger and reveals the distillery character again, wow. Then spicy oak with notes of tobacco to dark chocolate, everything is there.Medium to long and because of the bitterness mentioned above, it has something special. Now again delicately fruity with mild smoky herbal notes. Wow. Very exciting. You want to test again immediately. Refilling is the order of the day."
161,Ardmore 1996,"Top PLVIslay auf Halbmast, ein wunderschöner Rauch ohne brachial zu sein, Vanille, Zitrusnoten, Sternfrucht, am Ende der Mischgeruch aus Kohlrabi und Vanille, saftige Orangen hinten raus, mineralisch im zwei Schluck Kraftvoller und mäßig rauchiger Antritt, viel Zitrusnoten mit Orange, leicht pfeffrig, kalter aschiger Rauch, leichtes Britzeln a la Ahoibrause, später etwas Vanille und dann die Eichenwürze Süßer Rauch, Zitrusnoten  und Vanille im direkten Zusammenspiel, wärmt schon lange, aber auch nicht zu lange"
162,Ardmore 1996,"Balanced, always interesting, fruity, slightly smoky. For me the better Talisker 18-yo! I find the alcohol better integrated than with the Talisker. There I had the feeling that he was too strong without water and unfortunately too gentle with water. I think the percentages are just right here. Not too lax, but also not too strong or burning.  I wouldn't recognize it in a blind tasting, although I found a note that reminded me a lot of the Ardmore Legacy. Is that the ""distillery character""? Because back then I stamped it as a ""bill note"". I thought it was the caramel.  I save further tasting notes, most of you should know that. I also trimmed the sample away more than dealing intensively with it. Was just too tasty. However, I am surprised that no sherry barrel should have been used. Especially when you rub a drop on the skin, beautiful cherry / berry notes rise. Delicious. After a short time you can guess the smoke. A big sip and you can also feel the smoke in the mouth and finish.  Delightful part!  88/100 points"

165,Ardmore 1996,"Dark EdgeArdmore is still a very important malt in the Teacher’s blend, but we are fortunate that it also appears on the market as a single malt, for Ardmore can be quite good. Take this expression, for example. Released in 2017 this malt matured on a combination of bourbon barrels and former Islay casks. I’m sure that will contribute to the peaty character of this Highlander. Is the 49.3% be cask strength, I wonder.Beautiful sweet nose on banana, liquorice, vanilla custard, oranges, apricots and eucalyptus. I was not expecting this, to be honest. It is a tropical Ardmore. There is hardly a trace of peat, despite the PPM and maturation (partly) on former Islay casks. But is it good? Absolutely yes!It is more sweet and sour than just sweet on the palate and the smoke also lurks around the corner. Having said that, it is again a very fruity party with summery, almost tropical notes. Grapefruit takes the lead. The alcohol is nicely integrated, by the way. A bit of oak shows some pepper and liquorice, but everything is nicely balanced. Some mint and honey keep it sweet and even offer a dark edge to it.The finish is medium long on citrus and chocolate, nuts and soft peat smoke. And delicious.What a brilliant Ardmore. The nose is great, the palate wonderful and the finish is simply grand. Available for 80 to 120 EUR. Recommended!"
166,Ardmore Legacy  Lightly Peated,"A real simpleton. Does not hurt anybody, but does not excite, either. In the same category as the - imho very superfluous - Talisker Ske, Laphroaig Select, and Glenlivet Founder's Reserve, to name a few the discerning world of maltsters does not need."
167,Ardmore Legacy  Lightly Peated,"Young, light whisky with a good dose of Highland smoke. He cannot deny his youth and unfortunately there are hardly any other aromas hidden behind the smoke.

Nice to add some smoke to another malt, but unfortunately too young and simple on its own. Note 3"

176,Ardmore Tradition - Peated,"Moderate honest, direct smoker, not too one-dimensional or boring, not too complex. The differences I find rather low, they are actually just next to each other, the slight vegetable note flies and as soon as I have only one of them, it is difficult to say which one it is. (1) is a bit fuller, more dignified, (2) a little tarter, smoker-friendly, but I would rate that as more of a whisky's normal batch difference than 2 deliberately different bottlings.  (For example, I found the differences between old and new Ben Nevis 10 or between the batches of a'bunadh, Talisker DE and Lagavulin DE larger.)  In this respect, the tradition is a good substitute for the Traditional Cask and with less than 40 € / liter bang for your buck.Direct Comparison (1) Traditional Cask peated vs.. (2) Tradition peated (73214):  (1) clear, but not too strong smoke, not medicinal, most likely campfire, light sweetness (caramel), a hint of pepper, slightly sweetish-kräutrig, rather gentle and restrained, (2) is slightly lighter, the basic character (especially the Smoke) similar, but more open, direct, intense, slightly herbier, a little less sweetness, but a note of cooked vegetables (kohlrabi?)

179,Ardmore Tradition - Peated,"Ardless. After spending so long enjoying the now dearly missed and discontinued Ardmore Traditional Cask, it’s time to finally try the thing that Beam Suntory decided would replace it. Straight away it’s not looking good. It’s obvious from the get go that the money men have looked at what went before and decided that there’s money to be made and costs to be saved.From quarter cask maturation bottled at 46%, it’s now an underwhelmingly predictable 40%. Still a NAS but where as you could reliably find info on the traditional cask being vattings from 6-13 years, there’s no such luck with this new bottling. My spidy senses are tingling and I’m guessing it’s mostly young; why make it any more expensive than it has to be. This is an entry level product, or so goes the reasoning. Ok, let’s not be judging the book by its cover, it’s the liquid that matters. Away with these dower expectations. Mmmmm on the nose things are picking up. There’s that strange Ardmore nose. Far less funky and smokey than what went before but sweet peat, stewed apples, sawn oak boards abound. It’s got that slightly silage note, it reminds me of a watered down basic Springbank. Vanilla, bourbon, ginger and white pepper. It’s not a bad smell at all. In the mouth and it’s fine. Compared to what came before it’s a huge step down but if we’re being fair to what’s in the bottle it’s fair. There’s no mistaking the watery nature of the product though. Little to no viscosity means it’s having to make up for a lack of mouth feel with flavour. It’s slow to arrive on the palate, the watery arrival gives way to a little pear, peat and ginger, oak gently grips the tongue, a light and spicy finish. It’s quite nicely balanced and is perfectly serviceable but there’s just no getting away from the fact it feels hugely underpowered compared to its defunct sibling.I loved the Traditional Cask, it was, for the money, a barnstorming malt. Unpretentious, full of character and blinding value. The replacement is none of these things. What a missed opportunity but, no doubt, a financial success for the money men and Beam Suntory."

I’m gonna sound awfully contradictory here, but there are nice notes of dry leaf smoke, wet leaves and hay, and damp earth and fresh cut wood. Though they say “lightly peated”, the peat does come through pretty well, it’s a little rubbery and faintly medicinal. Over it all, there’s a decent sized candied ginger and raisin-y sweetness that ties everything together.Spicy sweet to start with more candied ginger and honeyed grain. The peat and smoke here almost seem to trade serves with the grain and oak. They’re kind of on opposite sides of the net, it works, but they’re a little at odds with each other.

202,Arran 10-year-old,"Update: December 2021I will bump my old rating up by one... this is mega. Fresh oak, honey, not quite candied ripe fruits, herbs. More herbal and cereal focus on the palate, and that tobacco ash finish! A mini masterpiece.A wonderfully vibrant 10-year old - showing the industry how it's done! Doesn't pull any punches or aim at being soft or smooth - this one is full of flavour, so it deserves a bit of time.Orchard and tropical fruit balanced with fresh green wood, softened by the ex-bourbon cask usual suspects of vanilla and honey.Fruity, woody, sweet. Prickly. Give it a few minutes in the glass so the initially overpowering dry fresh oakiness can subside. After that, it's one of the more rewarding noses of any 10yo I've tried - very vibrant and lots to discover.Fruits blending with fresh woody notes. Pear, baked pineapple, green apple, grapefruit, blood orange, hint of apricot. Green stems and buds, pineapple stem, pear stem, hints of moss and tree bark, sap, propolis. Wild strawberries?All of this is supported by beautiful sweet notes: honey, vanilla pastry, caramel. Some hints of fresh, sweet herbs (clary sage oil).Slightly prickly, a balancing act between fruity sweetness and beautiful acidity. Woody with a fresh green tinge.Orange candy, banana, lemon, caramel, vanilla pastries, fresh budding fir needles (try them, they're delish!), mentholic nuance.Some spice in the development (cardamom, ginger), distinctly dry cigar tobacco / ash finish, reminds me of the aftertaste of lighter cigars.Cigar ash, red apple, honey. Quite dry, thoroughly enjoyable."

Still good bang for the buck, but perhaps almost too ""extreme"" to start a beginners' tasting with.Arran maltiness, yellow fruits, vanillastewed yellow fruits, a lemon-y component, but also rather strong oak influence and/or spicyness that makes the balance of the mal suffer a bit.

Really well made as easy drinkers go.Light, some spices, drier, but still some sweetness and toffee. Grassy notes, tobacco leaves, dried herbs, and cream."
208,Arran 10-year-old,Tasted and assessed in a blind tasting - ProefOlympics # CL2 - April 2020. Was a bit disappointing (but certainly tasty for the price.
209,Arran 18-year-old,"I am relatively enthusiastic about this bottling. This is a completely different malt than the old one. The focus is clearly on the ripening of sherry and it hits it quite well.  An independent ""winey"" profile with highs and little depths.  With he likes.A very slight alcohol bite is the first thing on the nose, but really minimal and with a little time it flies completely. Otherwise, the first thing to hold back is the nose. Extremely dense and rich but reserved. It sounds like a contradiction at first, I know, but that's the way it is.  Next comes a slightly sour / winey fruitiness that is not out of place at all.  Very interesting and far from being fully explored.  For all of you who have read so far: now it's getting classic:  Very nice sherry ripening with everything that goes with it. Old leather, tobacco, raisins, plums, a nice pinch of spice and the oak hilt gently follows and pushes in beautifully.  Over time, the alcohol comes back. That is the only point of criticism.The start is very gentle but not lax. He sweetly dresses the mouth area before the malt becomes more spicy with every second. Sweetness, fruit and spice hold the balance. Very pleasant  Everything is backed by a very pleasant carpet of wood and the tannins from it.  Again I have the sticking point from my nose: the alcohol is coming again.  While we're whining: it's a little one-dimensional, but by no means boring.The finish is not too long and very harmonious. Here suddenly cherries come and it is fresh again.  Coffee plays a role again, but more milk coffee."
210,Arran 18-year-old,"Noticeably different from the old one and also completely different on the nose. They are not comparable, because the old one is a bourbon / sherry whisky at its best and the new one is ""supposedly"" made with two different sherry barrels and is very demanding. It has certainly already leased its place with sherry lovers. On the palate and in the finish it is special and much spicier! You have to like that. The old one is not better, but only more independent ... Conclusion: ... Both are very good.Wow, fresh and fruity straight away. Very attractive. Will be the best part. This nose is markedly good. All nouns of fruitiness and wonderfully dominant but not too heavy, rather on the light, sour fruit side. Orange peel and berries pickled in alcohol. Splendid. Respect to Arran. This nose can be sold. Top!Sweet, creamy, inviting and not too full and heavy in texture. Rather loosely and lightly, it combines peppery tannin spices with fine to artificial citrus fruitiness and the inconspicuous chocolate bananas with raisins. Made class without being intrusive. Is inconspicuous, or shall we say “very soft” and a cautious finish. But what shouldn't be a criticism. Ingeniously balanced culinary delight without rough edges. Many will say something boring. I like that very much. Happy 88!Medium to long he walks with his head held high, without pursuing and simulating any show-offs. Solid and well coordinated, it slowly lets go of what it delivered from the nose to the palate. Finish at the best level and felt 2 to 3 years older! Claim: There will not be a day in the year that this malt does not work. He deserves an award, no ifs or buts. Congratulations to Arran!"
211,Arran 18-year-old,"Very nice balance of sour, fruity notes and spiciness. Plus the ginger spiciness - I like it a lot. Overall balanced and not very complex, but still not boring. For me a wonderful standard for the home bar.  (Rating: +)Sweet; sour and fruity; colorful fruit basket; Oranges; Raisins; Vanilla sauce; Spices; delicate beautifully integrated oak wortgentle fruity sweet and sour taste; which is quickly complemented by a fine spiciness as a counterpoint; Oranges; Grapefruit; fine tingling ginger spiciness lies on the tongue; Chocolate notes  Great balance of fruity sweetness and spiciness. Everything is very harmoniousmedium length; spicy; sour and fruity; Grapefruit; dark chocolate; some milk coffee; delicately tart oak flavor; Ginger spiciness"
212,Arran 18-year-old,"The nose smells a little sulphured to me at first but then settles down , a decent sherries nose on show here.The palate is nondescript and does not improve with water either.Adding even more water does not improve it, This is so boring I cannot be bothered to do a full tasting note, Arran is better from a bourbon cask in your view and I are always better than official bottlings.The quality to price ratio is rubbish, this is worth no more than £30."
213,Arran 18-year-old,"Needs some time in the glass, sweet at first and a little reserved. After a few minutes full and delicate.  Milk chocolate, trail mix, cinnamon and oak. Very balanced.Round and flattering, very gentle. Chocolate, raisins, dates, some cinnamon. Then the drier tastes, spices and gentle oak.  The alcohol is practically not noticeable (as on the nose).Medium length, gently spicy and fresh."
214,Arran 18-year-old,"Had this in a line-up with six Arrans, this was by far the darkest in colour (also compared to the 21). It's definitely more sherried than the old 18 years from 2016/2017 (wb id 79561). Still, it is no real sherry bomb. It has good and interesting flavours, but it's also a bit shy and collapes at the finish.Citrus fruits and pineapple. Milk chocolate with hazelnuts, croissant, honey, shoe polish coffee. A nice array of flavours, but it requires some effort: it's quite closed at first.Starts with the signature Arran fresh and sour citrus fruits, followed by 'darkness': dark chocolate, figs, crème brûlée and roasted peanuts.Vanilla essence, sour citrus fruits, bitter coffee and a oaky spiciness that morphs into soapy coriander."
215,Arran 18-year-old,"Heavily sherried malt that rests mainly on tropical fruits and vanilla. Probably American oak rather than European. This doesn’t have the depth of character of some of my other go to sherried 18yos like Bunnahabhain or Glendronach. But, it is also much more reasonably priced than those ones now. So as far as value goes, this delivers a great experience of what a good dose of aging and sherry casks can do. Just don’t expect those raisin/Christmas cake notes other more traditional European sherry malts provide. This one has a more modern, fruitier approach. Refreshing and tasty."
216,Arran 18-year-old,"At least my batch (first of the new line-up?) was disappointment. Very dark-brownish for a standard 18 yo, but the taste could not fulfill the promise given by the color. Not elegant as the previous version of the 18, not overly complex, tasted younger than 18 as if medicore casks were used. I wonder how the color got into the malt when the sherry was not dark but rather bright sherry influence with citrus fruit notes, oak tannins that kept be baffling. Even with time and air it did not become distinctly better. Let's hope newer batches are better.Bright sherry taste, more citrussy with some tobacco notesUnbalanced, rather simple. Taste does not reflect the color, seems like cheat - not even PX sweetness - sherry finish. No distinct Arran distillery character. Lackluster. Seems a bit waterey, too, despite the 46 abv.Short to medium long, some oak tannis remain, some of the cheap bright sherry notes, too."
217,Arran 18-year-old,
218,Arran 18-year-old,"This may just be my personal preference, but I would've liked less overt sherry here – perhaps as in the wonderful old 14-year-old. And I wonder what an all-bourbon Arran 18 (in the style of the current Deanston 18) would be like.A lot of sherry (dry Oloroso style), cranberries, christmasy baking spices, umami, trail mix and leather. Beneath the sherried overcoat, you can still sense some bourbon-matured components and the typical tart and citric Arran character. Pretty flawless, but also completely unsurprising. I feel like there would be zero added benefit in buying a whole bottle vs just a sample. No mysteries, rough edges, or anything else, really that would warrant long-term interest.I don't know, man. Somehow the combination of intense sherry and Arran spirit never works for me. The mellow, sumptuous vibe that Oloroso-centered maturation creates clashes with the pronounced acidity that Arran often displays. There's also a weird fizzy citric feeling to the palate, which doesn't fit at all with my idea of a sherried malt. To be sure, this is better than the old (ca. 2016) 18-year-old, whose sherry influence was a touch rubbery and artificially sweet-seeming, but I still wouldn't need more than a dram of this. However, if you like your sherried whiskies rather sour, fizzy-dry and tart, this is well worth a look. And the sweetness does return in the finish (see below).Aceto balsamico, redcurrant, brown sugar, cinnamon pastry."
219,Arran 21-year-old,"The second from the core range at the age of 21, but this time not limited, ... positive. One thing in advance. He can't get to the old 21! I share the opinion of ""Archer"". The palate has disturbing or almost missing notes, no longer on the acceptable side. Did the wrong barrels come together? Barrels not burned out enough? Unfortunately, whatever, went wrong with barrel management. The old 21 is clearly better! My personal impression. PS: See also the notes from Archer!Oha. Airy volume on the nose. Very fresh and flowery. It is also made on the light side and fine in aroma. Sweet Arran citrus with light vanilla and caramel notes. Against the 18s old & new, it weakens a bit and is not that full of fruity. Especially the new 18 series sets the bar very high. This 21 cannot fully convince his own 18 colleagues on the nose. And yet the nose is its best part. It smells delicious!Soft texture. But does not keep what the nose promised. Behavior simple, almost boring. Creamy and oily ok, but getting dry with a delicate bitterness that is also slightly annoying. But he stays cute! There is also some burned wood. The malty notes also go in the bitter direction. The oral cavity is worth a maximum of 84. Sorry Arran, that's not enough! Was it saved on the barrels here? At least this batch was not optimal.The finish is also not up front. Just a little sweet and sour. After that it gets lukewarm and, unfortunately, reluctantly, he goes there for a medium time. It's a shame, he didn't hold out either. In addition, he is strangely grumpy in the back. Personal Opinion: One of the barrel rows was treated incorrectly. Compared to his very good 18 brother in the PLV, things are certainly not easy for him. Once again I say “a big THANK YOU to my brother in spirit for the great rehearsal”! Stay healthy !"
220,Arran 21-year-old,"One very famous cap-wearing Youtube reviewer just gave this a 91. The whisky in his bottle looks darker than mine, but mine is a recent release. I'm wondering if he's tasting the same whisky? I like the new Arran 18. It's quite tasty. But the 21? Um, no. Not even good enough to bother with tasting notes. I'm giving away my bottle to an acquaintance who did me a favor and is used to drinking far inferior whisky to this. He will love it, and that makes me happy."
221,Arran 21-year-old,"Dangerously tasty, and sweet for a 21yo. Set at the same time, and fresh, the oak tends to behave for the age, and herbal.It starts with cocoa and citrus notes. Orange and grapefruit, jaffa cake. A couple of dried garden herbs, marjoram, thyme, and fresh tomato plants. Then comes apple compote with some cinnamon and vanilla.Strong start, oily mouthfeel, a strong, dark caramel note makes the beginning, and combines with ripe oranges and some cinnamon. Vanilla. Roasted hazelnuts introduce the oak, which is more herbaceous.Medium. Orange, cinnamon, caramel, vanilla and milk chocolate."
222,Arran 21-year-old,"The nose is filled with an assortment of dried fruits dominated by raisins, prunes and marzipan. The taste is slightly sweet, tannic with hints of milk chocolate and salted caramel. Medium-length finish, astringent, chocolate-caramel. It is inferior to the old 21-year-old not so much in quality, but in depth of organoleptic and interestingness, but otherwise it is a very beautiful whisky. RATING: 87pts - | 87 - 89 (B +) → Great | - Always nice to have a bottle of this."
223,Arran 21-year-old,"A honest Arran, representative for what this distillery has to offer. Although I can't get used to this dry and bitter herbal finish I often experience with Arran.Rather dusty, with the tyoical Arran fresh citrus notes. A bit of yogurt and coconut biscuit. Opens up more more: redcurrants, guava, and floral notes join the party.Fresh and sweet fruits: Sicilian lemons (much sweeter than the supermarket ones) and passion fruit. It has an oily mouthfeel, that also reveals some vanilla, croissants, and fine (not bitter) garden herbs.Waves of sweetness, mainly on orange marmelade. It's a bit spicy (coriander?) and has an metallic edge. Unfortunately becomes more dry and oaky after a while."
224,Arran 21-year-old,"(Tasted semi-blind; I knew it was Arran, not which one)NOSE: Lovely fruitiness on the nose with fresh yellow apples and yellow plums. Then more typical bourbon barrel notes of vanilla, dried banana and other dried yellow fruits. (87p).TASTE: The arrival is soft and fruity, again yellow orchard fruits. The fruitiness really continues onto the mid palate all the way into the exit. Lovely fruitiness plus some sweet barley juice. It is just a little nippy, suggesting that this may be in the upper 40s or lower 50s, ABV wise. (86p).EXIT: More yellow fruits, barley juice, very mild black pepper. (86p).OVERALL: A fruit and barley driven, bourbon barrel aged Arran, where the distillate gets to shine. Almost pure fruit & barley juice, with just a minor bitter bite towards the end. Juicy but not very complex. Very recognisable Arran signature here, I think. Age wise I would think 12 - 18 years old. TOTAL SCORE 86 points."
225,Arran 21-year-old,"Damn a shame that with this great nose it breaks down on the palate and in the finish. One could almost assume that a few bad barrels were mixed in. This musty and musty note, which he shows on the tongue, scratches pretty hard on the border to the missing note.At first contact you could almost think that the whisky could not be located on Arran, but on the Kintyre peninsula a few miles west - a little Glen Scotia lemon here, a little springbank minerality there.  Very fresh nose with just that lemon, sea salt, dried seaweed, damp pebbles. Straight sliced apricots, nice and fleshy and juicy. A touch of flower shop with fresh cut flowers pulls through. White chocolate, nutmeg. Fresh fruitiness and spice complement each other very well.Creamy start with tart herbs and a musty note. The freshness from the nose is barely there, the older barrel and damp, clammy wood clearly prevail here. Keller Moder. A stark contrast to the fresh-looking nose. There is an inkling of putrefaction here, and you can hardly identify and name specific flavors otherwise.Shouldn't be as long as it is.  The musty and putrid note settles on the tongue and takes root there. Bitter herbs, cellar, damp wood, wet autumn leaves, burnt caramel."
226,Arran 21-year-old,"tasted this one at spirits in the sky very disappointing whisky no dept , short finish , almost no complexity there are better things to buy for 150euro"
227,Arran 21-year-old,"Various Arran expression surprised me quite a bit but also several ones disappointed me. The line so far was rather linear. That means, the more ages comes in the better it seemed to get. Where the 18yo was all about sherry, this 21 seems, purely by color, more sophisticated.Fresh, sweet and sour. Ripe tropical fruits get to my nose instantly. Ripe banana’s, melon and apricot. Also darker flavors like cocoa and floral notes like in flower buds. Also quite some vanilla. Enough sweetness but also something sour like yoghurt.Very oily on the palate with loads of citrus and tropical fruits. Mid-palate quite some dry flavors like in cinnamon and almond paste start to take over. Also Mediterranean spices play a part.Medium-long. It’s a logical continuation of the palate. It’s remaining in dry flavors mostly, being lead by Mediterranean spices, vanilla, honey and a whiff of corn like in popcorn. Quite some bourbon-driven flavors. I don’t really know it with this one. I expected more of it to be honest. It’s not bad, certainly not. But somehow it can’t really please me neither. Water doesn’t change a lot. It’s tasteful but it’s a what you see is what you get kind of whisky at the same time. I’d prefer the 18yo. More depth and complexity is to be found there."

229,Arran Sherry Cask  The Bodega,"Nose: strong sherry aromas, but they are very fresh. A nice mix of light fruity, citrus and sherry flavors. Flowery, caramel, toasted almonds, hazelnuts, raisins, marzipan, lemon, blood orange, sweetened peppermint tea.  Taste: oily, sweet, great onset, sweet / spicy, he pushes on with schnapps squash, apple juice, dried fig, peach, overripe pear, again the nut corners, milk chocolate.  Finish: Medium long, very sweet, the oak is noticeable, becomes dry but remains sweet and slightly tart, the citrus notes always resonate in the background.  Nice connection of the citrus-freight with the sherry-flavors, the alcohol-strength also fits very well. Not too young and no sulfur. Of that I could imagine a bottle zuzlegen, he is probably not too old, so it lacks in the mMn a bit of depth. Is still delicious"

231,Arran Sherry Cask  The Bodega,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2021/01/20/swag-whats-in-your-cupboard-december-2020/N: Comes across as rather obviously/blatantly sherried at first, but not so. Given time, it’s far more subtlety sherried with wax capacitors into citrusy [PX-ey?] raisins – an Arran clue there – cello-tape and Airfix glue in the background, red fruits, red apples, fusty fermented/drying leathery umami,… plenty here,…[no sulphur],… needs exploring. T: Well made whisky with ‘more oloroso over >> PXey Arran‘, I write before Kenny nails it again. How good is he? Excellent is what! Descriptors-wise, we’ve thick fusty sour green confectionary wine gums. Without interfering cask influence, there’s no talk of the seams between cask/spirit – it’s all nicely consolidated. One might argue this is painting by numbers, perhaps, yet the painting is very good. Nothing wrong here.F: Sour sweet creamy, almost emulsion-thick creamy finish.C: Around €40 or £50, this is very good. Whilst some of the more established distilleries have struggled with adapting sherry-dependent profiles of their whiskies due to the new generation of sherry casks [Glenfarclas/Highland Park, for example], Arran seem to have found and maintained very decent quality [sherry] casks that suit their spirit, since their establishment in 1995.Scores 85 points, all day long"

235,Arran Sherry Cask  The Bodega,"(Lot 20 08 19)APPEARANCE: Between dark copper and medium brown colour. NOSE: Initially sherry and wood notes, mint and some dried fruits and noticeable oak notes. With some air; dry, baked oak, sawdust, some alcohol, all overpowering the sherry. With more air the sherry cask reappears; vanilla, some dried fruits (quite dry impression), then molasses and some honey. Later dark treacle and dark honey. Dark chocolate. (86-87p) With a few drops of water it feels less oaky, more sherried and slighty older. After my third addition of a few drops it really starts to come around on the nose; oranges, lemons, dried orange rind, fortified sweet wine, some fruit cake, pine needles, mint. (87-88p)TASTE: The arrival is mainly sherried (on rather dry, dried fruits) but also a bit woody and a bit nippy. On the mid palate a mix of wood / oak sawdust and dried fruits, with a little sweetness towards the end. (85p) With a few drops of water more of the sherry notes come forward. With another few drops, the whisky becomes sweeter, more sherry, less oak. Even better after my third addition of a few drops. Also sweeter. (86p)FINISH: The finish is peppery, woody and slightly sweet. (84p) With quite a bit of water the finish becomes more civilised, rounder, less woody/peppery, softer. (85p)OVERALL: Straight after the initial uncorking and undiluted, this presents itself as a quite intensely oaked and sherried, relatively young (5-8 years?) whisky. What it doesn’t do is reveal much of its Arran distillate/origins, although (hard) dilution brings some of it into the light. Several drops of water makes the expression older, more sherried and “smoother”. TOTAL SCORE (for now) 86 points. I will let this breathe and re-review later, in some 4-12 months time."

289,Auchentoshan Dark Oak,"Crème BrûléeAlongside the American Oak Reserve, this Auchentoshan Dark Oak was launched in September 2019 as well, exclusive to the global traveller. Next to bourbon casks, this release was also composed with oloroso and PX sherry casks, hence the name. I’m fortunate that my friends Pascal and Ellen visited the distillery early October and brought me two bottles: one to share and one for the collection.The nose is very candy-like and sweet, which is no doubt thanks to the sherry casks in the mix. Sultanas and pineapple, baked apples and candied oranges come first, followed by lemongrass and vanilla and finally some crème brûlée. Neither the bourbon nor the sherry casks dominate, creating a fine balance.It is nicely oily and fresh at the same time. Honeysweet from the first sip. A touch too sweet to my taste even. Luckily some woodspice are there to counter this somewhat. Yes… leave it on the palate for a moment and you’ll soon notice it offers the best of both worlds. Wonderfully sweet notes (candied oranges, candied sugar, sultanas), a lovely spiciness (pepper and nutmeg) and a hint of toasted oak. Again: well-balanced. Good job.The finish is between short and medium and remains candy-like sweet.Less delicate than the American Oak Reserve, but with a much broader scala of smell and taste and thus more interesting. For an entry level malt (because that’s what this is after all), this is very nice. Thanks, Pascal & Ellen for (literally) carrying this weight from Glasgow to Ghent."

299,Auchentoshan Heartwood,"In my opinion this malt is slightly underrated on Whiskybase. Of course it does everything to make the hardcore whisky fan cringe: It's NAS, it's excessively coloured and chillfiltered. Thank god it's at least bottled at 43% - any less and it would lose any substance. Being presented like this is a shame, because the juice in itself is very fine. The interplay between sherry notes, bitter wood spices and the fruity character of the distillate really works, and the notes of blood orange marmalade, grapes and chocolate are quite marvelous. At less than 40€ for a litre bottle the price is fair too. Don't hesitate to try this if you are looking for a good soft sherried unpretentious everyday dram (but keep an alternative with more oomph ready) and a good session starter."
300,Auchentoshan Heartwood,"In the nose hints of sherry clearly recognizable, even if nothing dominates here - everything is well integrated.

[80 - 76 = 'really not bad'-whisky --- but do I need a (second) bottle?], But for the PLV: 83/100sweet, dark fruits, with a dash of acidity (strawberries / plums not yet fully ripe). Raisins and some marzipan are added. Spices (nutmeg and cinnamon) are only in the background and develop over time. Light oak note.soft start, which is then a little stronger (peppery). Sweetness and fruit are there in the same way, but are then slowly displaced by the spices. It tips over into a slightly tart note (dark men's chocolate / espresso), but is still far from bitterness. Second sip: it becomes more viscous, creamier, ""darker"". Third sip: something nutty (macadamia / hazelnuts) emerge.the spices / oak seasoning and the tart note remain in the mouth for a long time.

319,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"[February, 2018]  I had my last 'toshan Three Wood quite a long time ago and I cannot remember how it tasted.  So I appreciate this opportunity to re-taste a sample provided by a friend.Sorry, not my kind of a pleasant dram.  You might enjoy it if you prefer the bitter side of life...The colour is russetmuscat and the texture shows small tears with rather fast legs. The nose is very oak-driven (obviously they use a lot of virgin oak in the newer batches) with a significant herbal spike (caucasian oak, I guess) like the Ardbeg Kelpie. Unfortunately, this is not my favourite profile - it compares to many other modern designed whiskies that I do not like either (by the way, these profiles are designed ""out of despair"" because of the cask shortage due to the long-lasting whisky boom).The taste itself offers more of the sherry flavours (that are very shy in the nose) beside the heavy wooden and strong herbal notes. Better, but still not good (according to my taste buds).The whisky arrives quite bitter and astringent in the mouth, another clear sign of (too much) aggressive virgin oak. Not to my liking either. The finish is rather short and again somewhat bitter-astringent from the tannins of the virgin wood. Water increases the (anyhow strong) herbal aromas both in the nose and on the palate and it turns the finish even more bitter."
320,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"3 casks of different sherry:  sherry, a little dark chocolate, a little mushroom, mold like dried lichen.  more spices, it's creamy, intense woody on grilled coffee too. Toasted traces and some honey!  the maderized side, black fruits, cooked fruits, it is soft, without concession!"
321,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"First things first: this is actually one of the few single malts that I'd recommend you sip from a tumbler instead of using a nosing glass. It really needs the increased liquid-to-air ratio to come into its own. At first I thought I pretty much hated this, that it was just swamped by all the (wet) sherry-seasoned-cask aromas, that there wasn't anything to find except from pungent, overpowering, syrupy sherry.But it improves dramtically with some air in the bottle. Now (3/4 empty) there's a nice balance between heavy, sweet sherry and light, fresh Toshan citrus, which keeps the whole from getting too cloying. The palate has improved with bottle aeration as well: seems older now, more woody and musty and (again:) less dominated by vulgar wet/first-fill PX casks. Dark plums, hazelnut paste and chocolate pralines dominate the taste, along with some zingy spirit notes.Ends on baking spices, nutmeg, and cinnamon rolls. Nice flashes of dark-roast coffee beans in the finish, along with residual juicy freshness.If you're in the market for an uncomplicated, delicious, sherry-heavy malt with some additional fruitiness, you really can't go wrong here. I had this around 79 initially, but will raise my score to 84 now. What a difference some air makes!"
322,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"I got it as a club bottle at Whisky.de. But it is very difficult for me to say anything about it. Because I think that was the first whisky that I almost didn't get empty. I would like to join in with the good words of a member at the base, he phrased it appropriately: Original copy: I find strong wood aromas and a lot of sherry fruit to be pleasant, I still enjoyed the first half bottle, but then tried other drops, after a year with occasional tasting and compared to other sherry malts I had to give away the rest, its crisp, young note spoils me Enjoyment - it is probably also the distillery character, but that speaks against it that I like the American Oak very much"
323,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"A very interesting dram, not expensive, but with more flavors than triple distillation could predict!  barrels of bourbon, PX and oloroso.On the nose, caramel a little grilled, wood, dark chocolate!On the palate, slightly candied fruit, the wood still gives a nice sensation in the mouth. A little vine back and sweet spices for a good taste.In the final, it's always quite interesting with wood and candied fruits on the red fruits."
324,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"Either you like this kind of whisky, which almost goes in the direction of the liqueur, or you do not like it. I like her.Very ""old"" aroma, dark.Comes very old-sweet and heavy, cough-oil on the tongue; with a slight oak aroma. Malty. Very fine. And yes, the oak comes through stronger.Medium length, very nice finish."
325,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"Very intense, has good sherry, a lot of chocolate, but the artificial-flowery Brennereicharakter in the nose and some (youthful?) Sharpness shines through, for ~ 44 ¬ quite yummy, has a regular place in the whisky bar and is well received.rather intense, tart dried fruits, Storck giants, molasses, sugar beet syrup, old leather, furniture polish ... and in the background a slight artificial-floral touchvelvety-dry, but quite strong, a lot of dark chocolate, Sachertorte, some cinnamon sharpness, a touch Möbelpolitur / waxmedium to long, first very chocolaty, then drier, woodier, sharper"
326,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"This was a nice surprise, i didn't think it was going to be this good or that well balanced, and at a great price. Great whiskies and very affordable."
327,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"Another great range from this wonderful distillery.Quite a complex nose, Molasses, varnished old wood furniture, dates, dark chocolate, raisins, old leather armchair, red roses and treacle.First taste and i'm sold, nice and smooth dark chocolate, you can taste the wood on your pallet, it's quite dry but creamy, some summer fruit pudding and ginger cake. There is quite a good balance here.A long dry and woody finish with chocolate toffee on the death."

329,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"Tasting: http://www.whiskybase.com/whisky/43  http://www.whiskybase.com/whisky/51888  http://www.whiskybase.com/whisky/141918  Color: Russet / Muscat  A few thoughts on the three:  - Auchentoshan is really not the big deal among Scotland's distilleries, but it has one of the most penetrating distillery characters. And I have a thing for their stuff.  - By the way, whisky.de is the only source I know of for the age of 12.5 years. With the newer ones, I'd be more willing to believe that.  - One of my best examples of a great finish. Yes, it is ""designed"" through and through and full of fresh wood. But: firstly, in the right price segment, secondly, there is a coherent overall picture - I don't know of any other whisky that tastes like Christmas. Third, you can still taste where the whisky comes from (even if I wouldn't say that Auchentoshan is a very malty whisky).  - Between very old and medium one seems to have learned how to deal with wet barrels (or not so wet barrels anymore, I mean). The old man got way too many tannins.  - Almost no difference in taste over five years. Respect.  - Maybe I need another bottle of it.Heavy cinnamon, a little nutmeg, pretty sweet. Spiced plum jam, orange peel, fresh hay, gummy bear sweetness. Artificial apple flavor. Freshly cut grass with air, more hay, pine needles, some tree sap. Incense sticks. Some lemon peel, lavender.Not as bad a burner as the old one. Not that sweet at all, good combination with dry and spicy. Cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, anise. Dried plums, less dates, orange peel. With a bit of chewing, it's pretty grassy, a real shed of hay, grain (the drink) I imagine that a little more Oloroso will come through (fully ripe plums). Hazelnut, Brazil nut.Yeast, soot, cinnamon, hot coffee. Not bitter, rather short."

332,Auchentoshan Three Wood,
333,Auchentoshan Three Wood,I've never liked the Auchentoshan Three Wood. In my humble opinion the selected casks destroy the delicate character of the spirit. This one here is a good example for bad maturation. The malt smells artifical and has some realy distusting chemical notes in the background. The taste is bitter and unpleasant. Better look out for some good bourbon casks from Auchentoshan.
334,Auchentoshan Three Wood,
335,Auchentoshan Three Wood,"For starters, this is for a very dark 2020/2021 batch of TW bought in Sept. '21. It is worth mentioning that - btw just as with LP Triple Wood - these bottlings have lately undergone drastic color fluctuations from amber to dark mahogany (and back). Just as with the above mentioned this has clearly affected the taste (if for better or worse lies in the eyes of the beholder). Also you repeatedly come across 'smart' folk here in Germany that claim just b/c it says Enhält Farbstoff (contains colorant) it must do so and hence the difference in color stems from artificial coloring by E150A. Obviously these folk neither know the details of the german labelling requirement, i.e. that this disclaimer gives you the legal right to add colorant but is not necessarily a statement of fact as the distillery is not obligated to execute its right, nor do they understand what E150A is used for, i.e. to create uniformity not to create funny color variations from batch to batch for shits'n'giggles while the taste remains the same to confuse customers, nor have they taken a sip of the different batches and experienced said clear differences. As for this batch, it is a dry and a bit bitter sherry note and previous batches seemed more accessible. Ok, one more piece of trivia spotted on the back label in the discription of the used cask types. While during the distillery tour in 2019 the guide (no student helper) of Auchentoshan emphasized that this bottling in fact does NOT contain cask finishes (with sherry) but instead is - in his own words - unique in that the three different whiskies are each fully matured in their respective casks and then married before bottling, hence Three Wood and not e.g. Triple Wood. Now the back of the packaging states the contrary. I wonder if they changed their policy for whatever reason. If this makes any difference in taste, again, lies in the eyes of the beholder. :-)"

On the second occasion, a little more ripe fruit. Peaches.Fresh and fruity at the beginning. Fresh fruit. Apples. Citrus. Later on, a lot of honey appears. A bit of a barrel. A pinch of spices.Bittersweet finish. There is some burnt honey, but at the same time clear oak bitterness. Minimal perceptible spices. Only oak bitterness remains for longer."
341,Auchroisk 10-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"Light dram, even if with no great personality. It starts promising sweet and gentle notes, with a nearly absent nose and some fruity (pear) hints at the beginning. Then the profile doesn’t grow much on the palate, resulting in some average vanilla and sweet almonds taste and ending up with bitter oaky notes and a bit of alcohol dryness, quite unexpected considering its 43 abv. Not bad at all, even easy drinkable but not much interesting and generally unoffensive."
342,Auchroisk 10-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"Malty, nutty, doughy, earthy, creamy, floral deliciousness. The fruits are there too, in the form of rich ripe pears. It is quite a unique whisky. Shame this is the only OB Auchroisk and it's only 43%. I need to seek out some independent bottlings."
343,Auchroisk 10-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2020/10/15/impromptu-swag-social/C: This bottle has been open for a number of years. Since I last tried a F&F Auchroisk [back in 2016], I don’t think much more of it now than I did then. In fact, it’s even rougher now than I remembered it, though its resemblance to the previous Ben Bracken and Whisky Broker Speyside Distillery offerings – in style – is noted."

347,Auchroisk 10-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"For such a relative simple bottling; nothing fancy, a bit sanitized, it has taken me many tastings to get to know this whisky. It takes water very well, it is not easily drowned. Even a 1:1 ratio does not necesarily kill it (see below). And still just 43% abv. Many indies available. This is how the owner Diageo wants to show it, via their own indie outlet: F&F. Happy with that.Grainy. Nuts. Light sweetness. Bread dough. Metallic. Savoury herbs dressed with sugar. Marzipan and honey.With water the nose is very different. All separately definable notes are integrated in 1 undefinable aroma (and we call it: whisky). No hint of alcohol in the nose.The arrival is full and hot. Quickly shifting into a medium-long development of sweet and sour of juicy oranges, tangerines, some lemon. With water the heat in the arrival is gone. In fact, the arrival is gone. One big and long development of all sorts of juicy fresh citrus fruits and barley sugar. In the background there are the savoury dried herbs.The finish is dominated by a dryeness and bitterness of citrus white flesh. And later it becomes sweeter, leaving the aftertaste of barley sugar."
348,Auchroisk 10-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"a zesty zing to it with a cashew-like nuttiness, not a bad Speyside; i felt adding a few drops of water helped take off what was a strong spirit rich hit to begin with"

350,Aultmore 12-year-old  Foggie Moss,If you like Speyside whiskies (like I do) and you want to try a decent priced standard bottling (I paid €35) at 46% of a lesser known distillery then this might be a good option. To me it stands out from the pack as it's less fruity-honey but instead has a very herbal side to it.
351,Aultmore 12-year-old  Foggie Moss,"Aultmore 12YO is a good initial malt. It’s an enough sweet with pear note, with strong notes of wood and cereal, with spices. The palate appears with sweet pear note, and goes with grass, wood, black pepper, hay notes. The finish is a middle, spicy and dry with green pears note. It’s a quiet good for drink with friends during patties. "
352,Aultmore 12-year-old  Foggie Moss,"Well, that's young, I would say. The barrels were certainly not bad, but that does not tear it out.  Notes from a blind tasting.  Really interesting, even the second blind tasting, where he does not convince me. Last time he had gotten 79 points, this time it was only 75, on average 77. Granted, this time it was the seventh malt in the series, not the very best condition, but he just can not really like me.  The lax impression of the first time has also confirmed by the way, I have typed here again to 40%.Right typical bourbon notes immediately, yellow fruit in honey, the alcohol is well integrated. Clean, round, without surprises. Heated the fruits disappear, what remains are caramel and honey. On the second try a light but clear, salty sweat note and tons of malt, very grainy, rather little fruit and sweetness.Fairly sweet, honey, gruff alcohol, bitter notes at the end, metallic crackling. The second time less sweet, a little more mellow, still young.The sweetness goes, bitterness stays a bit longer, medium."
353,Aultmore 12-year-old  Foggie Moss,"knitted quite simply nice fruity sweet thanks to the slightly dirty nose and the tingling oak in the taste and finish, it won't get boring I like it very much, on a par with other 12yo OAsquite sweet and fruity, but also a bit dirty o musty, like refill sherry behind it vanilla, cream candy the sweet malt comes out more strongly with watermilder, quite oily and sweet then tingly and again the cream candies with water the paint becomes even more oily and malty hardly any oakshort to medium length fruity-sweet with the sparkling oak with water, the sparkling is missing here too"
354,Aultmore 12-year-old  Foggie Moss,"This was my favourite bottle of last summer! It's incredibly fresh, certainly a high quality entry level OB! Made me try other Aultmores, but this is still the best for me so far.Spring in a glass: grassy, lemon, green apple, hops, and freshly cut flowers. A bit sweeter after a while with apple juice, limoncello and malt sugars, but also some coriander, fresh laundry and kiwi's appear.Full and clear on rhubarb, citrus fruits, redcurrants and yogurt. Various herbs, almost like a sterrenmunt tea. Vanilla fudge and honey provide sweetness, while it also has a mineral edge.More fruity now (citrus, apple, strawberry). Fennel seed, roasted peanuts, a bit mineral again. Maybe some cardboard, which brings it down."
355,Aultmore 12-year-old  Foggie Moss,"Nose: floral and slighty vegetal, fruity with fresh pears and apples, butter. Water and breathing time brings out vanilla and some roasted almonds.Taste: light but not a thin mouthfeel, vanilla with a fresh fruitiness of pear and ripe galia melon, some vegetal oiliness and black pepper.Finish: buttery and nutty with a spiciness of black pepper and bitter white grapes.A real nice entry level Aultmore, fairly priced considering quality and presentation of what's in the bottle."

358,Aultmore 12-year-old  Foggie Moss,"This is quite simply a great buy at the price. Accessible yet rewarding for the patient sipper.Bread and malt dominate with a little sourness following up.Not overly complex, bread and malt again are the main notes. Well executed. A summer dram for the fall months if that makes sense.Oak, more malt and grapefruit peel. Decent length."
359,Balblair 12-year-old,"Very little cask influence, tastes young and not like a finished official product by the distillery should taste like. Not super terrible, of course, but disappointingly sub par nonetheless. What were they thinking?! Maybe if shop shelves are empty and this one's for sale for 24 EUR? My advise: If you have to spend 40+ bucks on an entry level, pick pretty much any other bottle instead (except maybe Jura + Loch Lomond NAS)."
360,Balblair 12-year-old,"Little impressive Balblair. The price of this standard bottling is really too high.Grassy, honey and vanilla. In the background a hint of coconut.The alcohol is present. The whisky is oily. This should normally be positive, but this dram does not touch me. Vanilla and a bit spicy.Short finish with an annoying bitterness."
361,Balblair 12-year-old,"That's pretty much what you would expect from a typical ex-bourbon whisky. It would be nice if on the palate, the beautiful fruits from the nose could better prevail against the malty notes. In addition, I would like to have a little more oak notes, which is barely noticeable here.Instantly strong vanilla with some lemon in the nose, creamy and sweet, I think of custard with a splash of lemon in it. In addition a few bright fruits, both stone fruit, as well as something exotic, banana, yellow peach, and a hint of mango and coconut. A malty muesli note is in the background, and a hint of oak is very reserved.Easy onset, silky mouthfeel. Again strong vanilla, then malt and cereals, significantly stronger than in the nose. The lemon and the yellow fruits from the nose are back, but much more restrained than in the nose.Short finish, vanilla and malt are still dominant, some lemon is still there. The oak comes with some light nougat yet to light. Develops a sour note on the finish."
362,Balblair 12-year-old,"RATING: 81pts – |80 – 82 (B-) → Okay| — No major flaws, worth tasting.The nose is plain and simple with a profile of vanilla and wet wood followed by caramel and fresh hay.The taste is sour and bitter, simple with touches of grapefruit zest, vanilla, caramel and wet wood.The finish is short, pretty dull with hints of bitter herbs, grapefruit zest and assorted spices."
363,Balblair 12-year-old,"Tasted in a Balblair range share line-up.The 'new' Balblair, which will replace the vintage line-up with a more normal age statement. Not a very welcoming newcomer...Sweet and grassy. Little dirty and farmy note, not bad though. Smells a bit young. Maybe not the most active casks?There is a bit of pineapple in here too. Overall it is just fruity, without being able to describe the fruits.Young, little harsh. Tingling alcohol, sweet, straw, marzipan, fruitiness.Short-medium length. Sweet but it turns bitter quickly. Little straw and hay. Not very well made."
364,Balblair 12-year-old,"Not too dissimilar from the 2005 vintage, but with just a little more character and depth.Very light and it takes a little while to open up, but then it goes right into apple cider territory, accompanied by hints of vanilla, coconut and oak shavings, but also lemon and sour beer.Pleasant oiliness with a hint of chili pepper and a certain oaky bitterness, as well as a bit of green apple and soft notes of barley husks. A touch of ginger too, as well as bitter lemon peel.More of the above. Medium in length."

In the mouth, same scenario, the fruits jostle with a citrus zest in the background. Some cereals, malted barley, wheat, puffed rice. Dried fruits, grapes, apricots. Caramel on the finish, it's smoky, earthy, chocolatey. Relatively long. It makes a decent set. https://ilikesky2020.blogspot.com/2020/12/balblair-12-yo.html"

Spare a thought though for Balblair sales ambassadors who have had to face the music from frustrated fans. Let’s see what the new range has to offer, starting with the 15yo.C: It’s nice, it’s distillate-led and current Glenallachie fans should relate. Similar in calibre to the 2005 vintage [WLP84], there are improvements whisky-wise, from Balblair’s [first release] 2003 vintage [WLP82]. Price-wise in the UK, we’re looking at an approximate price increase of  57% over comparable aged vintage releases. "

Mandarins and vanilla, I mean to find a little weird note again ...Yes, it also tastes a bit soapy, it is also a bit spicy.

379,Balblair 18-year-old,"Part 3/8 of a Balblair range share. The previous 12 and 15 were decent whiskies and pleasant to drink. Let’s see what an adult Balblair has to offer.The nose gives a nice balance between the lighter bourbon cask flavors and the more intense sherry butt influences. One is not overpowering another. That’s a good start. I get leather, espresso, apricot and dark chocolate. Mild spices and some toffee of the bourbon cask are still there in the background, supporting the whole and giving it a mature and complete nose.That is what I call a silky arrival. Creamy after a short while. A treat to the palate and evolving quite nicely. Ultra soft. Sweet and pleasant! Apricot, a whiff of tobacco and caramel fudge. A little more sharp/bitey spices join after 10-15 seconds.Finish is medium-long. It’s delicate and friendly. Here it gives a fudgy mouthfeel. Caramel sweetness and a tad bitterness of burnt oak wood. Without taking the price in consideration this is probably the most complete of the 3 (12,15,18). BUT taking the price into account, this is way to expensive. I guess that is thé Achilles heel of this expression. For let’s say +/- €60 this would be something I consider buying. At the current price..hell no!"
380,Balblair 18-year-old,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2020/01/22/twe-show-2019-balblair/C: The same profile as the 15yo, just with more oak maturation, simples! Also, there’s a touch more mushroom foostiness on the finish gaining it an extra point. The price of around £115 is a stretch for a malt of this calibre and age however."
381,Balblair 18-year-old,"Tasted at the distillery.The line up of 12, 15, 18 follows an even progression.With a progression in price as well.The 18 has the most flavour, yet the 15 was my fav, and still I think the 12 is best value for money.This has spent it's extra years in some good sherry wood.The sherry influence is much deeper than on the 15.Still not completely covering the lighter fruity notes of the bourbon casks, but this has added notes of raisins, prunes, more and darker chocolate, coffee and leather.Very rich on the darker notes without going to any extremes.Well rounded and on the sweet side, although it feels a bit more dry than it's younger siblings.We are approaching a long finish.Chocolate and coffee, slightly drying."
382,Balblair 18-year-old,"Tasted in a Balblair sample range share. This one was my last sample. I can conclude that I don't have to buy Balblair anymore. Price-quality is gone. This is a good example of it.This is a decent nose. Nice balance between the sherry casks and the bourbon casks. There is straw, hay, sawdust and red fruits. Hint of coffee.Sweet, little hint of sour. Sawdust and little honey. After a while clear sherry notes show up.Medium length. A tad bitter if you ask me.

Chocolaty, sweet orange, ripen red apple, soft spices, mildly waxySoft arrival with medium to thin body and impressive sweetness (but interestingly it was rather bland on my first night of tasting).. Rather complex. Slightly tannic, nutty, lightly popcorn, pleasantly meaty, evident bitterness balancing the sweetness. Tongue-spreading lemony acidity.Woody, biscuity, drying, apricot, dried hay. Not being impressive and long-lasting."

Here the annoying elements are already subsiding, but unfortunately the 18 year old doesn't really want to inspire either.Coconut, vanilla.

389,Balblair 25-year-old,"Two things here:-1 - This is a really nice spice/fruit combo of a whisky, tastes good, balance is good and so easy to drink.2 - It is an absolute disgrace that Balblair think this is worth £495 WTF, seriously, there is premiumisation and there is being on planet la la land, who does their pricing strategy the Clangers?I am afraid this is a perfect example where a brand has aspirations way above its premium worth.The whisky is lovely but not even worth half of what they are asking, shamefully overpriced to the point of making me say that if this is the way whisky is going generally then all distillers like this can sod off.I have bought many Balblair over the years , never again, I think they should take a long hard look at themselves for having a nerve like this."
390,Balblair 25-year-old,"Nice whisky, very balanced, with beautifully integrated oak. Classic bourbon maturation, which was just “loaded” with sherry and because of that features dried yellow fruits. Proper ABV also gives a plus to overall impression. Well, now is time to talk about the bad side of this expression - its price. To be honest it’s a robbery. Over 500€ for things that you can get for 3-4 times cheaper from other distilleries… makes the purchase of this whisky highly non-recommended.Sweet, light, fruity and caramelly (pear and apricot acid drops), honey, sultanas and dried apricots, vanilla, lychees, sweet orangesSweet, gently spicy (rose peppers, a bit of ginger), vanilla pastry, quite strong but soft and gentle oak with a piquant bitterness, apricot jam, some herbs, orange zest, red overripe berries (raspberry, currants)Rather long, sweet and warming, with vivid nutty notes and soft oak.

How come this vendor can sell it so cheap compared to the Brit shops, perhaps they are not as greedy?"
395,Balblair 25-year-old,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2020/01/22/twe-show-2019-balblair/Let’s talk about the 25yo’s £500 price tag this way:⁃Balblair’s fabulous official 1983 vintages [31yo+], are still available for significantly less than £500. I even found an official 1975 vintage available online for less than £400.⁃Balblair 1989 [20yo+] vintages, frequently appear on auction sites and regularly go for around £100-120.⁃For £500, five superb official 1997 vintages on the secondary market are yours⁃,.. or six G&M Balblair 21yo’s with change.You decide. To the juice!C: A mix of bourbon and sherry cask-maturation can suit Balblair’s spirit rather well. There’s no obvious sherry action in either the 15 or 18yo, but then the overall cask influence isn’t direct, it’s subtly integrated. With this 25yo, there is more obvious sherry maturation up front – an oloroso finish? As a result, I find a butyric oakiness at the back of the palate. Even up to 50/50 water dilution doesn’t resolve it. What a disappointment."

A great bottling, I like it very much. 22/22/22/23 (89P)Light amber shines in the glass, on the glass wall of my Premium Snifter a multitude of small ""legs"" make their viscous paths. Roasted aromas and hazelnuts dominate the first impression with apricot and vanilla.

Slightly floral and grassy hints emerge, mushy bananas and ripe pears are sweet and fruity on the nose, the alcohol is wonderfully harmonious.Apricots and pears, caramel and chocolate, the first contact on the tongue is sweet and fruity. Bit by bit tart and spicy wood tones are added, hazelnuts and malty grain followed by meadow herbs and a hint of old vanilla. Fresh mint and a hint of menthol tickle the tip of the tongue with a peppery spiciness, chocolate and honey are added. Hints of citrus fruit and zest of dried oranges, again slightly floral and minimally grassy.Mild and dry floral notes stick to the palate, dry wood tones and notes of hazelnut follow, toffee and hard caramel end in creamy whole milk.

Lesson 1 of good whisky without being sweet.  Oak benches in the fragrance, as far as I am concerned, the trademark of the Balvenies that I have been able to taste so far - most, very desirable Balvenies are beyond my budget. Non-offensive, a typical English-language term, which I consider untranslatable - and more often used to describe whisky - is very relevant here. I honestly cannot imagine that you really do not like this whisky as a lover. Maybe a bit flat or bland, impersonal or not very memorable - but dirty or unpleasant, no.  New liter bottle in 2018. Quickly empty. That is also due to the smooth application in my shares.

Then the finish falls off the cliff, leaving behind traces of oranges and dark chocolate. It's not bad, but this whisky could be so much better!RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"
456,Balvenie 21-year-old  PortWood,"I think the beguiling nose and the proud age seduce many whisky friends to rate this bottle very highly. But if you carefully take apart the main part and the finish, it becomes clear that this dram has its weaknesses precisely there. Because it only delivers the texture relatively thin and is no more convincing than any other good 21er. Plus no rough edges. Only the violently peppery start. But that's exactly what I found annoying or inappropriate, because with only 40% you shouldn't expect that. This is also disappointing for those who bought it for that very reason. The Balvenie 21 was also available as a ""duty free"" version with 47.6%. I would be very interested in that. For this comparison I will park 20cl. Thank you very much to ""little dram"" for the great rehearsal.Very pleasant nose with dark berries and exotic fruits of all kinds. Seductively tender and loving, it plays back and forth in a grandiose balance between ex-bourbon (hogshead?) And the port pipes. With vanilla and tropical fruitiness, it comes across as very elegant and impressive. Incl. a wow effect, because the nose is a unicorn experience. Respect to Master David Stewart.In the approach surprisingly strict for the 40%. Also a bit dry and thin with a sharp base. The dried raisins and the nutty transition are now pleasant in the main part. Then dried berries come out very woody. With a touch of grapefruit it makes a bit of an impression on me but then looks dusty and dry on the finish. The depth and texture of a 21 are not shown to their best advantage. No palate waves, no up and down. Only the one-way street in the exit. Question to the master: Has it been in the barrel too long?Medium to rather short. He didn't hold out. It's a shame, this dram doesn't deliver what the nose promised. At the back, it looks too simple. It's a shame, I'm a little disappointed because I expected more. A blind tasting would be appropriate and fair here. The name, the age and the great nose had screwed me up too high with my expectations. Greetings to “little dram”: Fortunately, the sample is big enough. One evening does not come to a fair judgment here. I will touch up the days."
457,Balvenie 21-year-old  PortWood,"RATING: 87pts – |87 – 89 (B+) → Great| — Always nice to have a bottle of this.The nose has a nice berry and autumn profile with notes of foliage, spicy wood and black currant.The taste is berry and fruity with hints of cherry jam, raisins, cinnamon donuts and notes of chocolate.The finish is pretty long with nice hints of vanilla and berry compote followed by sawdust and straw."
458,Balvenie 21-year-old  PortWood,"Nice autumn dram, needs higher ABV for the price"
459,Balvenie 21-year-old  PortWood,"Thunders on all sides. Soft, subtle nose, hard to describe; some wood, a little thin scent. Nice taste, of course - and Balvenie, and 21 years, and a portwood finish; what's not to like? Late follows the smell of water mint and very late finally comes the port and wry / dry tannin. Very good but I do not taste 175 euros. Bottle that stuff at 46% or higher and you have a classic, I think so."

461,Balvenie 21-year-old  PortWood,"I don't think this on deserves a high price. After 21 years of maturation, you expect something better from Balvenie. Sad to bring this on 40%ABV.Not a bad whisky though, simply not worth the money.A delicate nose. Quite some hints of straw and grain. Little hint of the sweet and sour port. A hint of ripe apples but overall it gives cornsyrup sweetness.Sweet and mild. A little thin mouthfeel. Grain notes and a hint of vanilla. In the background clearly the port influences.Medium length. Sweet and a bit drying. Hint of sawdust and again straw."

463,Balvenie 21-year-old  PortWood,"N, glue, green melon, strawberry, tart raspberries, some heating oil, after a little time in the glass, leather aromas set in. There is some coffee. M Soft on the tongue, light middle part, powerful finish, which quickly loses its intensity, but lingers with ease. Some mocha approaching, a few berries. All in all, a reasonably sophisticated malt that you have to look at more closely. ABV is a disaster though. Pretty thin, colleague. That makes it hard to grasp the flavors. This makes the whisky at best an everyday dram. Pretty contradicting for the price."
464,Balvenie 21-year-old  PortWood,"Thin and watery. Might as well be drinking water from a port soaked cask. Nose is not too bad if generic, but the mouthfeel is simply nonexistent and the taste leaves only grainy astringency shortly after a sip. I'm not a fan of Balvenie's slightly grain forward characteristic (also prevalent in their 15-yo bourbon single cask and young underproofed malts) and here it prevails again. Maybe my bottle was open a little too long, but why bother bottling anything at 40%? 70-75ish malt, under 60 if price is a consideration."
465,Balvenie 30-year-old,"I'm 1/3 into this bottle after opening this three weeks ago, it seems kinda tight. Not very complex at all, kinda of dull. Water doesn't seem to help much. Will see if this opens up more in the coming weeks.I'm now down to 1/3 left and this isn't really doing it for me. Not bad but not great. And not good for a $1000+ bottle.:-(Vanilla, very light sour fruits, barely. You would think at 47.3% abv it would push out more than it does.Musty light chocolate, burnt sugar, caramel. Very soft flavour.Medium, a little bitter with sour winey notes. Not much to add."
466,Balvenie 30-year-old,"[February, 2021] This is very expensive stuff and I wonder if it is worth the heavy bucks......and actually, it is not. This was distilled around the end of the last whisky crisis in Scotland (1983-1989) and obviously the budget cuts did harm the quality of the spirit and/or maturation at Balvenie too (maybe they bought some cheaper barley or used below-average casks due to the budget pressures, who knows). I strongly suggest to do some basic research on whisky vintages before buying such expensive stuff - provided you want to enjoy it not just by looking at the bottle... Oops, just if you care: As a drinker I would not spend more than 100 Eurobucks on a bottle of such drinking quality - and this is not a joke!The colour is amber and the nose offers a delicate but somewhat shy old-style Highland profile with the trademark Balvenie honeys supported by nuts, waxes and autumn floral notes. This is nice but actually I expect a little more from a 30-years old maturation of one of the finest malts of the Speyside. After some breathing... not that much happens which is again strange for such a long maturation. This smells like a much younger dram, and it does not really smell like my beloved Balvenie to be honest.The taste is a little weakish too for a 30-years long maturation of one of the finest spirits of the Speyside. The complexity is somewhat limited compared to other drams of a comparable age and the wood is dominating over the malt flavours which happens often with rather leached (exhausted) casks. Did this dram fell victim to the budget cuts of the last whisky crisis? It seems so, in a blind tasting I would have guessed an average Speyside dram of a second-tier distillery (Balvenie is first-tier, usually) not older than 18 years.The initial mouthfeel is warming but a little hot-spicy with some bitter-drying tannic moments. The finish is of medium length only which supports the thesis of a rather below-average-quality whisky distillation because the length of the finish (like the initial mouthfeel) is very much determined by the oiliness (texture) of the dram. This is the ultimate test of the quality of distillation, finally. The finish turns distractingly bitter-astringent towards the end, which usually indicates leached casks again. Water releases some more aromas in the nose (shy fruits) and turns the taste smoother but not more interesting. I like this dram best when a little reduced to about 43% abv."
467,Balvenie 30-year-old,"deep, but clear, easy to read whisky, incredibly balanced and calibrated to the smallest detail.  91 (n23, t22, f23, b23)The aroma gently intertwined with Balvenie's signature features: honey, vanilla, fresh bun, and grapefruit. The noble shades of aged whisky are felt: cracked wood, old leather, lacquered furniture, chocolate, figs.Taste: soft, with notes of croissant, vanilla cream, fudge and honey. Tannins are felt, but they do not dominate, but only shade the main composition.Aftertaste: long, smoothly flowing, warming. The first wave consists of the nuances of sweet pastry, honey and yellow apple. Then spice spices and milk chocolate appear. Following are the tones of delicate oak and the flavor of a cigar."

474,BenRiach 10-year-old  The Smoky Ten,"GreengagesBenRiach has been known for it’s peated expressions so clearly this had to be included in the totally new core range. This was a distillate from both peated and unpeated barley and matured on a combination of bourbon casks, virgin oak and Jamaican rum casks. It is clear that Rachel Barrie got access to whatever the warehouses had to offer and used that playground to BenRiach’s advantage. By the way: this is bottled at 46%, while the unpeated version – The Original Ten – has to make do with 43%.The smokiness is delicate and supportive, certainly not dominating. What is dominating are the apples and greengages, as well as some honey and… coconut! Truly good and fun too.It could have done with a bit more body I suppose. This is a bit light. But the taste is just fine: honey, peach, greengages, coconut and then a soft layer of smoke on top that brings along some cinnamon and candied ginger.I am pleasantly surprised in the finish by salted butter, creamy honey and vanilla, but mostly the smokiness that just lingers on. My mouth turns cozily warm. At the death the greengages appear once more and thus form the leitmotif of this malt.Lovely, friendly priced, peated BenRiach. Around 45 EUR."

484,BenRiach 10-year-old  The Original Ten,"Spicy Entry Level MaltLate summer 2020 BenRiach launched a new core range. Bottles and tubes got a new look, but more importantly: Rachel Barrie (my muze with Auchentoshan a few years ago, remember?) created this new ‘The Original Ten’ from a completely new recipe. Three types of wood come into play: bourbon, sherry and virgin oak. A tidbit of knowledge: this is the only one of the new range that is bottled at 43%, the others are bottled at 46%. Let’s get to work!The nose is soft and very accessible with lots of fruit like nectarines, apples and pears, but also melon and apricots. The virgin oak adds some extra spiciness, including vanilla and cedar wood. The body is just fine and the malt is immediately both sweet and spicy. Vanilla and caramel, but also some nutmeg and chili peppers. The fruit is limited to overripe pear and apricots, but is joined now by some woodsmoke and nuts. And a freshly baked croissant! Lovely.The vanilla, nuts and spices linger in the medium long finish. I’m actually getting cozy and warm. Man’s best friend with balls, thanks to the spices. Around 35 to 40 EUR, which I find very acceptable. Great entry level malt."

491,BenRiach 10-year-old  The Original Ten,"According to BenRiach’s Brand Ambassador (who was hosting this tasting), the current core lineup with the 3 Cask Matured style (and the older age statements using 4 Casks) was established by Dr. Rachel Barrie (GlenDronach’s Master Blender) who also oversaw Benriach when Billy Walker sold both distilleries. Considering the excellent work Dr. Barrie has done over at GlenDronach, we couldn’t wait to see how Benriach would turn out.The Benriach Original Ten (Aged 10 Years) is approachable and a solid dram. It’s not a legendary standout, but for $50 US (£37), this is a great value. It tastes like a easy-drinking Speysider, welcoming and not watered down, even if it’s only 43% ABV. Hats off to Dr. Rachel Barrie for creating an entry-level bottle that is legitimately enjoyable even for hardcore whisky fans.It’s not the most complex dram, but if I was at a bar that had Benriach Original Ten, I’d be glad to order it as a starting dram for the night.Vanilla, apples, grassy, gentle. There’s very little ABV burn even from a fresh pour.A touch thin on the mouthfeel. Light orchard fruits, honey, apple, apricots, vanilla, light ginger. On the mid-palate, light oak, new wood, slight bitterness that helps balance out the sweet notes.Medium. Light ginger, apples, fading honey."

Taste is very easy, not a rough edge to be seen, vanilla tart, more custard creams, well-integrated oak, touch of green bell pepper and white pepper in the finish, along with rusk biscuits. Drinks as easy as water. Very clean and well-made. Pretty much the perfect example of a vanilla Scotch whisky (in all senses of the word). The only cask type of the three I can taste is refill American oak. It's a very good clean drinkable whisky. Nothing fancy, just super-solid. Blind I'd probably have it down as an accomplished blended Scotch. 3.5/84"
493,BenRiach 12-year-old  The Smoky Twelve,"Banana Bread in the OvenThe new core range of BenRiach consists of a 10 and 12 years old, both unpeated and peated. The fun part is the fact that all four expressions are made up of different cask types. That makes it quite interesting in my book. This Smoky Twelve is a vatting of bourbon and sherry casks, but also Marsala wine casks. Intriguing, no? Must be nice for Dr Rachel Barrie to have such lovely panoply of casks to play with as Master Blender.Top nose! Lots of oranges and roasted almonds, but with a lovely smoky edge. Some raisins and red fruit shine through in the background. Walnuts and cloves in the mix. Banana bread in the oven. If it can keep this up on the palate, we have a winner.While the body is somewhat light, the taste is great. The Marsala has put its foot down, offering up quite a bit of red fruit like cherries and strawberries, great notes of dark chocolate, cloves, candied oranges and vanilla shine through as well. Very complete, round and simply satisfying.The almonds and mostly oranges reappear in the medium long, softly smoky finish.This is my favorite of the new core range, while I secretly had hoped it would have been an unpeated one.

A slightly sweet and sour freshness rises from the glass. Honey, lemon, also oranges, pineapple, heather, vanilla, summer lilac blossoms, ripe strawberries and fine oak spice.Very light body.

Good standard whisky, but a few more sherry notes in the taste would have been good. He gives the impression that mainly ex-bourbon barrels were used and not quite as many sherry barrels. Somehow I don't get anything from the port. With a follow-up test I now come to 84/100; before that 82/100. [85 - 81 = delicious -> get a second bottle if price is within the range]At first there was an alcoholic tinge in the nose, but it went away after a while. slightly floral and herbal / spicy notes together with light fruity aromas of apricot, red apple, juicy and sweet pear. Every now and then hints of a greenish banana, which gives the malt a sour touch. With a little air, darker (sherry) notes come to the fore, which also brings some nut (towards fresh hazelnut) with it. The herbaceous-spicy (oak) note dominates for me, Over time, it turns into a freshly cut grass note that looks slightly musty (leave the grass covered under a plastic tarpaulin). [Follow-up test: I have now managed to get sweet peach very clearly; it seems fruity to me]Quite a gentle start, spice builds up, but remains elegant. It immediately becomes creamy and oily on the tongue and spicy aromas (black pepper and nutmeg). The fruit aromas are initially suppressed by this flavor. In the second sip, the fruity notes come out a little better, but the spice still predominates. A little malt and very light nuttiness (macadamia). With the third sip, the light-fruity aromas are good. But accompanied by a tingling and slightly peppery flavor. [Post-test: Notes remain largely the same; it seems a bit peppery and spicy than the first test (daily form); I also got some vanilla flavors]the malty character remains stuck to the tongue together with the wort for a while.

It wasn’t 300% better than those bottles, and in fact, everyone in our whisky group agreed that we’d rather buy multiple bottles of the Benriach core lineup at those lower prices and enjoy, than pick up 1 bottle of The Twenty One.It’s not bad at all, and a solid offering, but in this case, the extra age only mutes the smoke, but the additional expected elegance and complexity of other flavors isn’t there.Honeycrisp apples, dried fruit. Raspberries. Old furniture, leather. No peat.Raisins, dusty, old furniture, stewed dark fruits. Orchard fruits appear now by the mid-palate. Light wood bitterness.To understand just how potent the older release of the Benriach 17 Year Septendecim was, even after a 20 minute break and plenty of water, when I first tried this new Benriach The Twenty One, I thought it was 100% unpeated. The brand ambassador assured me that it was peated, and only by the 2nd taste did I start to pick up some light peated notes.By the 2nd taste, there’s a very gentle, delicate smoke that’s clean and pure. This is back to the Highland-style peat that I had enjoyed earlier with the Benriach Smoky Ten and Smoky Twelve, except even more delicate.Medium. Caramel, leather, old furniture woodiness fading in the background."
522,BenRiach 21-year-old  The Twenty One,"BenRiach 21yo The Twenty One, 46%, four cask matured - bourbon, sherry, red wine and virgin.Golden orange-yellow. Aroma is clean, fragrant and fruity to start. Underripe plums, both yellow and red. Some tomato puree, bloody Mary, Worcester sauce and some acrid smoke come in later and then all that weirdness sticks around. No, I don't like it. It’s too savoury and tomato-like on the nose. Could be the red wine casks (which rarely work), or it could be the virgin oak (I get a similar vibe from some ‘craft’ bourbons when very small charred casks are used).Taste is cloves and pink peppercorns up front, salty, soft biscuity wood, 'creamy' oak middle, spicy peppery into the finish. Lingering full oak on the palate, burnt wood. Rising charred wood and black pepper. Tastes pretty good, but unfortunately the aroma lets this one down a lot. 3.4/81"
523,BenRiach 25-year-old  The Twenty Five,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2021/05/27/spotlight-on-benriach-a-world-of-flavour/This one is made up of bourbon barrels, sherry casks, virgin oak, and madeira casks.N: Whilst I liked the Bordeaux wine cask influence on the 21yo, the imparted madeira character of this one easily trumps it. Though a resinous sappy tannic mildly saline soup once again, we are now beginning to see a slick briny greasy weightiness that offers up suggestives beyond the nuts & bolts.T: With a salivating slick [cabbage-like] sweetness, all that wine influence remains candidly evident, as too, those ageing/aged phenols. At 25 years+, things have inevitably begun to converge, and yet, dislocate at the same time.F: Still ringing true of both sherry and madeira cask influences, we’ve a simple enough conclusion, though the whole mix frankly comes across as a bit of a repair job. The vibrancy of those casks continues to chug away, still biting, still tannic, sappy, briny,… still that lingering ashy heat,… lemonade popsicles?.C: 10 years or 25 years, it’s swings and roundabouts. Sure, the oldies win out significantly, but at what cost? This one: £300+ at time of writing."
524,BenRiach 25-year-old  The Twenty Five,"A bit of character is missing here, the barrels involved seem to take away some of their virtuosity from one another. The quarter of a century is taken from him, but many cooks end up spoiling the broth.Nutty sherry and caramel, apricot and forest honey, sticky orange syrup, hints of salt, dark chocolate with sweet cherries and strawberries, brittle, slightly spicy oak and waffles, candied kumquat, occasional notes of fine ash and wet algae, pear compote, vanilla purée, plumsold and aromatic oak with clove and cinnamon, apricot and orange, caramel and dark chocolate, slightly astringent with cocoa, whale and hazelnuts, again honey, salty hints, apple, banana and vanilla, tobaccolong, spicy and warming, chocolatey with cinnamon and clove, ashy with apricot, some dry oak, pepper and vanilla, hazelnuts and walnuts, forest honey, cocoa powder, pear compote, apple"

526,BenRiach 25-year-old  The Twenty Five,"All in all quite tasty, but considering the many years of maturation and the very high price, this is a very disappointing bottling for me. What can be the reason now? This wild selection of casks almost seems like an act of desperation by Rachel Barrie, after Billy Walker has already filled all the excellent and passable casks and then left the sinking ship. Too bad that Benriach is clearly on the decline due to or since the change of ownership.The nose is strongly influenced by the Madeira barrel and comes up with sweet and tropical notes. A few sour notes are also added. Ripe mango, kiwi, papaya, vanilla, gooseberries, quince, mint, white pepper, malt, soft apple, red currants, fine oak spice and pipe tobacco. Wild herbs are added later. Overall, the nose looks very young, but becomes increasingly complex when you give the malt time in the glass.On the palate, too, an interplay between sweet Madeira notes and somewhat tart, slightly dry notes. The body is only slightly oily, initially disappointed my expectations in view of the old age. White pepper, soap, salt, mango, peach, red grapes, toffee, orange juice, oak seasoning.Medium-long, slightly dry finish with peach and some cardboard."
527,BenRiach 25-year-old  The Twenty Five,"While I really enjoyed some aspects of this dram, and the Madeira cask influence was noteworthy, the jump in price for what the dram delivered was disappointing. At £260 / $400 US, that’s about 8 (Eight!) bottles of The Original Ten and The Smoky Ten, and about 7 bottles of the The Smoky Twelve. And so far, those 4 younger core bottles are more enjoyable in a relaxing, “enjoy a dram with friends” sort of way.Rich bouquet of dark fruits, raisins, caramel, stone fruit, toffee. The Madeira is very prominent, and makes The Twenty Five standout from all the previous bottles.Stewed dark fruits, baked peach pie filling. Caramel. The 46% ABV doesn’t bother at all. There’s a very light smoke that appears by the mid-palate, but still quite gentle and in the same Highland-style peat as seen in the Smoky Ten and Smoky Twelve (clean, campfire).Medium. Peach filling and cinnamon-ginger spice fades away."
528,BenRiach 25-year-old  The Twenty Five,"BenRiach The Twenty Five - 25 Years of Age - Four Cask Matured 46%. Sherry, bourbon, Madeira and virgin oak casks. Deep dark orange. Aroma is gummy sweets, fruit pastilles and Skittles, faint smoke, increasing smoked ham, a squeeze of lime, some tequila and stove gas. An interesting, relatively complex, aroma. Quite harsh in places though. Not an entirely clean or fully mature-seeming nose (which is odd given the age). Oily in the mouth. Initial taste impressions are muted, becoming sweet and honeyed, the breathy muted smoke waits until you've swallowed and then it lasts and builds. The smoke starts becoming dominant over a few sips. Hammy. Rich toffee starts backing up the smoke. Good character from the casks without them taking over. This is a very solid whisky. Older peated BenRiachs continue to impress. Not the best I've had from them but still a very, very good dram indeed. Grew on me and I could have gone slightly higher with the score here, but I think I landed on a fair score comparative to my other ratings, and given the harsh nose. 3.8/90A"
529,BenRiach 25-year-old  The Twenty Five,"A typical Benriach as you know it: Very aromatic, lots of wood, honey, vanilla - but also some glue. The taste is a mixture of sherry-sweet and wood-spicy. A slight bitterness, significant barrel influence. I'm not sure if the best quality was used. Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad drop. But at just under 300 euros I expect more ..."
530,BenRiach 30-year-old  The Thirty,"OMG! Delicious, dark sweet nose on raisins, heather, hint of chocolate with pieces of candied fruit and hazelnuts. Hint of (good) rubber. Ecoline. Aromatic and complex. Softer than a baby's bottom, but again with that delicious combination of fruit and peat. Very layered. The finish is slightly drying and makes me long for another sip."

533,BenRiach 30-year-old  The Thirty,"I was the most excited for the Benriach The Thirty release. One doesn’t get to try a 30 Year aged whisky very often, and given what Dr. Rachel Barrie has accomplished with revamping Benriach’s entire lineup, and the excellent job on The Original Ten, Smoky Ten, The Twelve and Smoky Twelve for their great Quality-to-Price ratio, these last 3 bottles feel like a slight step backwards. They are not bad at all, but The Twenty One, The Twenty Five, and The Thirty especially don’t perform up to their astronomical price points.I would certainly enjoy more drams of the Benriach The Thirty – it is tasty, no doubt about it – but given the retail price (£600 / $750 US), I would rather enjoy Benriach’s new younger lineup (especially The Smoky Twelve) and use the leftover ~$700(!) for many other bottles in the future.Robust port on the nose immediately. Confit figs & plums, light nuttiness.Sweet, dark raisins. Coating mouthfeel, lovely. Stewed figs on the front palate. Surprisingly this was the hottest ginger of all 3 later bottles (The Twenty One, The Twenty Five, and The Thirty), even though all 3 bottles have the same ABV (46%), and this one is the longest aged. Second sip reveals more raisin and honey notes. The Highland peat is still quite delicate if a bit more layered. Definitely a campfire in the distance type of potency, which adds just enough light smokiness to make this dram more interesting.Long. Lingering gentle campfire smoke, ginger fading smoothly. Dried figs, raisins also start fading away."

536,BenRiach Smoke Season  Double Cask Matured,"This one came late to the recent renewal of the Benriach core range. No age statement, but with a nice high ABV with a virgin oak influence seems quite lovely. And peated highlanders are always welcome.Overall fairly simplistic, but enjoyable as is. It does feel a bit young in the finish, but not immature.

537,BenRiach Smoke Season  Double Cask Matured,"A fruity, creamy and slightly sweet BenRiach with an announced, distinct smoky note, which is, however, very well integrated and thus not at all obtrusive. The alcohol content of almost 53% abv fits perfectly and only gradually releases the multi-layered flavours. Nevertheless, adding water - at least from my point of view - is not necessary, as the then dry oak spiciness and too much smoke overpower the creamy sweet fruit notes.I thank Destillerie Kammer-Kirsch GmbH for the complimentary sample!Sweet vanilla paired with campfire smoke on the nose. Accompanied by fruity notes of grilled apricots and peaches, together with honey and a little caramel.Sweet and fruity on the palate, strong and spicy at the same time. Creamy vanilla with peach and stewed apples, plus honey, spicy oak, some cinnamon and subtle wood smoke.The finish is medium long, sweetish, creamy and spicy with anise, pepper, a little BBQ notes and a touch of smoke.With water: After the addition of a few drops of water, more fruity on the nose with oranges and grilled apricots, plus dense smoky notes and a hint of peat. Sweet and creamy on the palate, but less fruit and clearly more smoky notes, plus dry oak and cold ash. The finish is medium long, creamy sweet with vanilla and some yellow fruit. Becomes much drier with time with oak and a lot of smoky notes."

539,BenRiach Smoke Season  Double Cask Matured,"From the start, there is a large country peat on the nose, sweet, earthy, vegetal. Hay, dry straw, and even a little manure, all this mixes with a very pleasant vanilla, candy sugar, candied rhubarb, sponge cake, dried banana and mirabelle plum. In the mouth, it is more on the lemon pulp, a dash of salt and spices, pepper, cumin, ginger. Brown sugar in the background.

542,BenRiach Smoke Season  Double Cask Matured,"The aromas are finely interwoven and nothing seems fake. The alcohol strength of almost 53% is barely noticeable, but it is very good for the malt. I like the combination of oak spice and creamy sweetness with the great smoke very much. He is straightforward, honest and no frills. If you like Bourbon Cask Whiskys, this is the place for you.Campfire smoke and the scent of caramel rise from the glass. They are followed by vanilla, oranges, lemon peel and spices. Cloves, nutmeg and coffee. The scent of sandalwood is in the background.It starts off slightly sweet with a creamy mouthfeel before a good portion of pleasant smoke floods the mouth. It is accompanied by bourbon vanilla, baked apples and cinnamon. The oranges return accompanied by light citrus aromas and heather honey. Paired with a light malt note, the smoke that is getting cooler lies in the mouth while the latte comes out.Oranges and white coffee linger in the mouth for a long time, carried by the smoke from the campfire. In the background there are pleasant, spicy wood notes."
543,BenRiach Smoke Season  Double Cask Matured,"Altogether a lovely dram! Very big on the mouth that makes it very distinctive; it is the kind of whisky that stands out in a tasting line up. The smokiness is sweet rather than menthol and balmy, which personally I am not a huge fan of the medicinal sort of peat. I have a bit of sweet tooth when it comes to this. This is really the highlight because with Smoke Season it is all about showcasing the Highland peat, that is what you are really here for. But don’t worry it doesn’t get too sweet though, it is not by any means syrupy. That much is balanced out by the smoke and the oak-y dryness that keeps it in check.The fruitiness is lovely as well, I love whiskies that are a big fruit basket, and this one delivers lots of grilled fruits so I really appreciate that. The body of the whisky is also of a highly respectable mouthfeel and is almost chewy, which is again what really makes this stand out.Link to review: https://88bamboo.co/blogs/the-bamboo-post/benriach-smoke-season-nas-52-8Colour. Amber, a really nice deep autumn tone.On the nose. Off to a solid start! The nose is certainly distinctive and fragrant. The smokiness is what sticks out first, but wait; this isn’t your typical herby balmy smoke, it’s a lot sweeter, kind of like char siu (no not you @charsiucharlie, you wish you smelt that good). It’s a meaty sweet smoke that you get with a good depth to it. Teriyaki glaze is probably close by as well.There’s also a distinctive malty quality to it as well, almost like butter biscuits with some dried fruit jam; very much like Marks and Spencer’s Redcurrant All Butter Puffs. Have you tried it? Absolutely love it. Light tartness to it as well, again like the redcurrant jam that cuts through the butter puffs. Otherwise crunchy green apples and perhaps a touch of lemon meringue or lemon curd.The smoke continues is wafts, interspersing fruits and ash. The ash has an umami texture to it, with a scent like burnt lavender and abit of brininess too of kombu. A little peppery if you nose it several times but really no bitterness or medicinal notes to be found. That’s nice, this fruity smoke.The palate. Very big on the body, if it stood out on the nose, boy does it stand out on the palate. The first notes that hits are the bright zesty citric notes; lemon, grapefruit, green apples. Comes with that leftover pepper from the nose, that prickle is definitely distinctive.But that gives way to that characteristic Benriach fruit basket, with a wave of sweet ripe fruits, red apple, pineapples, some mangoes even. This is tempered with some sweet bread dough; almost like doughnuts even. Kinda makes me think of the Krispy Kreme I had yesterday. The smokiness is present throughout. The ashy-ness just seems alittle like the slightly burnt ends of a pizza crust. Which come to think of it, the sweet dough really does remind me of pizza crust too.The finish is very long. There’s a drying quality to it as it fades out, I suppose this is the oak from the double cask-ing. There’s also a little chalkiness with it as well. Coupled with the sweetness it is somewhat like cinnamon breadsticks. The smokiness still remains, very warming and comforting. Remnants of milk chocolate and a mocha finishes it off. Else, it could just as well be churros with a nice milk chocolate dip."

The smokiness starts to show, smells like a cross between a bonfire and a coal fire. It gets creamy, vanilla aromas coming through with malty undertones.Some ginger spice coming through. there's something breakfasty in here, a bowl of sweet porridge with a glass of orange juice. With only a few minutes it begins to sweeten up, a herbal edge also begins making an appearance, I'm thinking of Mentos. Really nice balance, no flavour is overpowering, all in perfect harmony.On arrival it's earthy, a mouth full of highland earth and peat. Herbal flavours come across immediately, a gentle ginger spice on the tongue. There's an oatmeal porridge note forming the longer you hold it on the palate.Finish is burnt wood, charcoal straight from the barbeque.

549,Benrinnes 15-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"Going by the average score of this whisky here, there seems to be variation from batch to batch. And I'm sure I had a pretty good one with this 2007 bottling! Great character for what it's worth with being chill-filtered and coloured. It's proof you should never fully exclude these kind of whiskies. It has this warm vibe that's not alcohol-related, and that's all thanks to the casks which left a superb mark on this malt. Vastly different to contemporary sherried whisky as it's nowhere as drying or bitter. Even if it was only sherry-finished, there's some deep notes to discover. It's a well constructed malt with powerful flavours, but with a certain finesse. Kind of like James Bond. The finish is a highlight too, if not the best part of this dram. There's a chance some paxarette may have been involved here.. To clarify: it indeed has some sulfur-like notes but it's in the background. It's not distractive for me, but could be for others. Avoid sherried Benrinnes if you can't stand it at all, ex-bourbon matured Benrinnes is a very good fruity alternative. Final thought, this could have been legendary at cask strength.. Drool.Light sherry nose, refill or a combination with ex-bourbon casks I reckon, with a dose of trademark Benrinnes-ness. That slight, dirty/meaty edge is what I'm looking for and it's in here. Nice fruitiness with orange peel, apricot, apple, pear, cranberry, banana and raisin. Some deeper, sweet notes now with milk chocolate, cream sherry, Mars bar, sultana, marzipan, licorice and artificial peach yoghurt. Further on pistachio, peanut, glazed ham, menthol and some notes that make up the 'dirty' side: slight sulfur, soot, glue, cabbage and musty basement. Almost as unnatural as a whisky can get, but a seriously good nose. Absolutely no sherrybomb but the notes hit deep!Warming, but not from the alcohol. Takes you straight to the fireplace in late December. Some (slightly moldy) fruits like apricot, passion fruit, fig, apple, blood orange, overripe banana and raisin. Then a fair share of sweetness with jaffa cake, syrup, sultana, chocolate chip cookie and butterscotch. Walnut, peanut and malt mixed with a few herbs like vanilla, lavender and mint lead to some supportive savoury/funky notes that actually work pretty well. Those are beef broth, balsamic vinegar, cabbage, sulfur and stale beer. Lots of character and flavour but it doesn't scream at you. That has everything to do with the filtering and dilution of course, but it doesn't bother here.Not very long but has clear notes of dark chocolate, sultana, mint and pastry. A highlight!"
550,Benrinnes 15-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"Not bad indeed, but it could possibly be better with a higher ABV and non-filtration.

555,Benrinnes 15-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"Benrinnes 15yo Flora and Fauna 43%. 25ml at home, Sep 2021.Very dark amber, suggesting either first fill casks or e150a. The aroma makes it clear that it's the latter. Plus, Diageo made it, so…Aroma is pretty tired oak, the damp wood notes of a refill cask, more than a hint of ‘struck match’ sulphur to be frank, red apple, apple pie with too much filling and not enough crust. Becoming more figgy as the sulphur dies down over time. Settles on figs and violets, some burnt paper. If aromas could have colours, this would be purple. I completely appreciate that this observation makes me sound unhinged. The taste up front is musty, flat and tired, papery oak, underpowered gloopy and flat, slightly burnt notes, burnt yellow bell peppers. Watery and minerally with such a reluctant finish. Low impact across the palate and just totally without oompf. The flavour almost only starts about 5 seconds after you swallow. The initial impressions are unimpressive to say the least, although the late aftertaste seems to pull it back a touch, giving a hint of hope. The salt and pepper, the slight char and the faint fruitiness that come out, eventually, on the linger are totally necessary to carry you into the next sip, persuading you that the initial impression isn't so bad and that you should drink some more. This is very much a building dram - one which you have to keep the momentum up with. Once you've had a few sips you can sort of get on board with it a bit despite some very dodgy first impressions. If you stop drinking it and come back to it after a few minutes you go back to not really liking it that much. My first impression score would be significantly lower than my final score, but I'll be generous and give it my highest score. I ended up drinking all of my sample, but much more quickly than I would usually wish to. Needless to say you'll not catch me buying a bottle though! 3.25/78"
556,Benromach 10-year-old,"Give this malt time; it needs oxygenation, just like a Springbank does. Don't be too hasty in your impressions when first opening your bottle.Appearance: Bottle shape is great, but the label is boring. I didn't like the old snazzy label either. I'm not liking the choices Benromach has been making regarding its labels. I could personally do a better job myself by working with a freelance studio art designer. Nose: Putty, vanilla, Springbank 16 Local Barley-style paraffin, malty sea air (what kind of spring water was used to make this, the ""eau de l'eau"" smells better than past batches), scent of burning brush pile like I used to burn on my ranch, almost an Ardbeg style peat but fruitier like a good pipe tobacco packed down into a briarwood bowl. Maybe a will-'o-the-whisp of Br'er Rabbit's pine tar, with the baby in tow. And a cross between a Milk Dud and a malted milk ball. A malted milk dud?Palate: Sharper than the last 10 yo from Benromach, nice peat, fairly straight forward, peach pit, not all that complex but nice, lingering peat with a surprisingly long finish for a 10 yo at 43%, porridge, cayenne pepper, slight baby vomit reminiscent of the old Laddy. NO SULFUR BY GAD, VERILY.Finish: Peat mellows and subsides into a waxy, pseudo-vanilla paraffin note that is quite nice. Kind of a malty finish. A more than adequate finish that is longer than short, but shorter than long. Oh, oh, oh . . . ""where's my crackers!"" Now I'm getting a (dark) chocolate covered chile pepper at the death. What a way to go. . . not with a whimper but a BANG. This is the way the dram ends, this is the way the dram ends, this is the way the dram ends. . . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf8g7qD8_HACommentarian musings: Let's put Springbank 10 head to head with Benromach 10 and see what happens, score-wise, shall we? Both have 86 scores, but the Ben is a low 86.1 and the Spring is a high 86.9. The underwhelming 43% Ben is part of the reason. Four score and seven drams ago, our distillers brought forth, a way to escape the crown's taxation without representation, with stills erected along the banks of kills, which flowed like milk and honey (before relieving themselves into a vast of sea). Note to Benromach distillery's top boss in charge: up the ABV on yer Tenner to 46%, there's a nice bloke. Yeah, yeah, I know you've got a very decently priced and good cask strength offering. But hey, if you wanna keep up with the Mitchells, then bump the 10 up three notches on ye olde flagpole to 46% and charge three pounds more per bottle. Because this sauce would sing for its supper at 46% and we notice. Oh do we notice how much thinner and weaker it gets down at 43%. And good job keeping out the grotty sulfur casks. We hate that in Springbanks as well. SULFUR ON THE NOSE, ANYTHING GOES, SULFUR ON THE PALATE, BRING DOWN YOUR MALLET! (to swing at the bung hole 'n cork up that cask once again). For 'tis best not to use sulfuric casks (with enough to taste) in anything other than exotic marriages of special releases, you know, releases that would only appeal to nerds and weirdos: Devilish casks labeled as ""Funk & the Furies."" Maybe marry it to an apple wine cask or a manzanilla sherry. Charge more for the dickens and a certain type of drinker will nibble, especially these days. A surprising number of whisky drinkers can't taste a bit of sulfur. Maybe they have too many devilish genes, who knows. But the rest of us can, and do, and ewe!In other words, a scent of musket gunpowder is passable, but on the tongue . . . nay! ""Stand and deliver, your money or your life!"" The roguish reek of the devil's cologne in one's mouth is, quite simply, highway robbery. And, yes, it turns my stomach. That's why I had to give away a couple bottles of Benromach Cask Strength I bought a while back that were just too sulfuric for my liking. I could say the same about a Springbank single cask 13 year old port wood that never shaped up, even with over a year of oxygen in the poured down bottle. I gave that bottle away, as well! And then I found out (at the friend's house to whom I gave it) that the sulfur all but vanished if I wuz ta pour one third into a glass of two thirds Springbank 18 year old OB pure bourbon wood casks from a batch not too long ago (2019?). Ah well, live and learn. HIGHLIGHTS FROM NOTEWORTHY REVIEWS 88 from Surge protector: ""Nose: indeed, pretty farmy. Farmyard, hay, tractor oil, muddy slit, chalk, coal smoke, stale seawater, Play-doh, black olives, Asian fish sauce, crushed slate… Surely a lot of action in there, and a lot of character. Un-boring malt whisky. Mouth: absolutely excellent, starting very salty, tight, grassy (artichokes and just grass), with really a lot of olives, more salted fish, Seville oranges, salty tea and caramel… Not boring indeed. Finish: long, still very salty, sootier now, somewhat Springbanky, just even a tad 'dirtier'. Smokier aftertaste."" August 9 2021, the http won't register a specific page, just the Whiskyfun website, sorry.88 from Rueben sandwich: ""Still a rather unique profile, one of the basic must-have bottles for whisky lovers, regardless of their level of experience."" https://www.whiskynotes.be/2020/benromach/benromach-10-years-2020/84 from Too much to drink, I'm Ralfing: ""If they're using the money on rebranding it means they're not using the money on good quality casks for maturing the stock. Because there's only so much money in the malt pot."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHgRvKH8_00&t=805s------------------comments written before I tasted the sauce: I just bought a ""six pack."" Crossing my fingers they won't be sulfuric (me hates the sulfur). Have not tasted this batch yet. I will post my notes when I do.Based on the gap of nine months, I have to wonder if Benromach made a newer batch that Serge just reviewed. Hard to tell. I'm hoping I bought the batch that Serge reviewed and not the one that Ralfy poo-poo'd. Still, for the sale price I got, I'm not crossing my fingers (if there is a newer batch than the one Ralf reviewed near the end of 2020). And if the bottles don't fully excite me, then I may end up vatting the contents of one or two into my own alchemical creation, by adding a smidge of Ardbeg Uigie, along with a neutered mandrake's root, if there is a batch difference over the past nine months. I know, I know, both Serge, Ruben, and Cousin Ralfy (MITCHELL, who is indeed related to the Campbeltown Clan) made sure to write 2020 as the batch they are reviewing. But could there have been different batches in 2020? That's what I'm wondering. Also, this bottle is in direct competition with Springbank's lovely and delicious Ten Year Old OB, as you might have surmised. All things considered, who, then, has the lowest scoring review of the three (above)? Conflict of interest? A score of 84 does seem very dismally low, indeed. The last time Cousin Mitchell reviewed Springbank 10, he gave it a score of 86, which is certainly accurate, and possibly a bit low in my book. So I guess two points lower fer the new Ben Ten ain't outa line. Six years ago, he gave Benromach 10 a score of 89, which was very high indeed for a ten year. So, again, I see no conflict of interest whatsoever. And is Springbank really worried about competition these days? I mean, how could it be? The stuff sells out faster than hotcakes at a Cub Scout jamboree.Serge's recent review convinced me to buy (primarily because Springbank is so frickin hard to get these days). Ruben's review was the first out, but in all honesty the man is not at his best when it comes to reviewing peaters. I can remember when he rated some downright delicious Islays way too low (Lagavulins et al). He's come round, of course, but still. Not his forte. And, of course, this latest Benromach 10 43% can't rightly be called a ""peater"" as such, but you catch my drift. It's gamey to say the least, if past batches in snazzier bottles are any indication (I've tasted nearly all of the old-new releases in their gold label looks). Frankly, I don't much care for either of Benromach's labels. The newer bottle shape is more interesting to me (a blast from the distant past). And the older-still Benromach labels weren't so hot either. Which is confusing, to say the least, because the latest Benromach labels are supposed to harcken back to the really ancient Benromach labels. With this said, Springbank's newer somewhat garish labels also leave a bit to be desired. But then again . . . neither Benromach nor Springbank are owned by giant multinational conglomerates, so all is forgiven. ------------------The remainder written after I tasted my bottle and it passed muster:I will take a ""homemade"" non-ginaormusly-corporatized whisky in a cheesy labeled bottle any day over a slickly designed and marketed over-engineered and over-computerized, multi-nationally owned Scottish sauce (with little-to-no batch variation). Effemeral winging aspects? Scotland's Scotch production should largely be owned by . . . The Scots. Operation Mind F*$k. Shafted over. It's a curse-ah. And all of the clever Surge Protector Ad Industry dandies on earth won't change that fact, even with a self-infatuated sidekick named Angus (but not Scrimm). Gimme the good ole days when the majority of Scotch stills wuz still owned by Scots and the whisky flowed like time into the brain, with flavors and fleeting smells and phantasmogorical delights for body and soul alike. This bottle of Ten YO broth is not bad, by gad, not bad at all. Get one. Get yours. The price is right, especially in these trying times of runaway inflation and bargain vampires blowing clouds of spiked proteins in public while pointing fingers at actual human beings, which have yet to be GMO'd through various forms of Luciferase (quantum dots not optional). Support a privately owned distillery, just like the good old days. Never mind the Bullocks, here's the Urquharts. Quick--before the next multinational pounces, and the new owners of Benromach become some overly long and unpronouncable acronym."

559,Benromach 10-year-old,"The Benromach 10 in a new jacket. I was a little afraid they would have changed the recept as well making me doubt this would be able to meet up with the high level of the previous batch and presentation.Great! This starts very mature and acts way older then 10yo. Initially I get loads of great sherry flavors like wood polish, tobacco and leather. After a while more youthful fruity flavors appear as well as a pleasant charcoal smoke, which gives this whisky a great and highly enjoyable whisky!Right in between smooth and full bodied! It gives light and more heavy flavors. Loads of red berry and strawberry a whiff of peat and mild spices. Very good and extremely palatable.Long, oaky, smoky and mature! Great quality cigar tobacco flavors as well as silky and coating fruits, spices and leather. This goes extremely well with a cigar I think! Well in short: this is one of those whiskies you’d always want an open bottle of! It offers a hell lot and this is without a doubt one of the best Core range starters out there!"
560,Benromach 10-year-old,"A great value entry into the world of Benromach, the malt will be available at the end of 2021 for under €40, which is a good price for an aged whisky with no colouring. Benromach only uses 1st fill casks, in this case a blend of 70% ex-Bourbon and 30% ex-Oloroso. In addition, it is a Speyside whisky that is peated, so today it is more of an exception among the classic Speysiders. Does it make sense? www.glen-efze.deThis is of course not Islay peat, first you have to consider whether there is any smoke in it at all. But this consideration lasts only briefly, because then comes a nice, warm smoke that is restrained: smoke for those who find Islay too blatant. The smoke is followed by sweet, ripe fruit, pears and sweet, red apples. The whisky can stand still for a while, then the smoke becomes clearer, Mirabelle plums are added to the fruits.The alcohol is 43% vol. quite ok, together with the smoke it brings enough power. The fruits are there, peach and mirabelle plum, mixed with the smoke of a still slightly smoldering fire. Wood is not directly noticeable, but you can feel it on the palate and find what you are looking for. The bourbon casks contribute nice vanilla.The smoldering wood fire remains on the palate as a smoky covering. This is a nice whisky that boasts a warm smoky note combined with fruit. For the price and age this whisky is really good. On the one hand it is pleasing, but with the smoke it offers an aspect that gives depth and maturity that you have to like."
561,Benromach 10-year-old,"Super nice profile, so much character! However, It took me a while to finish the bottle. I think it is the combination of peat and sherry casks that just isn’t my thing, usually it results in a sourness that tends to clash with the sweet notes. Really good stuff though, and great value.Pretty rustic in form, a bit prickly even at 43%. Soft smoky vanilla, warm log fire peat, ginger, orange peel. There’s a sour facet to with some redcurrant and lemon peel as well. It’s all quite light and bright, making me suspect sherry-conditioned american oak. A dark, chalky mineral note keeps things interesting. Fresh clary sage, tobacco, cherry, clove. Good stuff!Well behaved, sweeter than expected, plenty of spice. Redcurrants, a little bit of honey, orange, vanilla and some coffee bean. Some peat, giving a hearty warming effect to it all. Delicious dessert notes of meringue and tonka bean. I miss some of the darker notes from the nose.Medium, on the dry side. Continued spice and peat, coastal freshness. Clove, cardamom, hint of savoury cheese, black and red currants. Well-balanced oak."
562,Benromach 10-year-old,
563,Benromach 10-year-old,"Very light peat smoke, a honey marinade on ribs, fried bacon, leather, black olives, dates, caramel, praline/milk chocolate, oranges and some peach in the background.Fried meat, lacquered with a sweet honey marinade. Zest of oranges, caramel, salt, hazelnuts, dates, olives and chocolate.Oranges, fried bacon, hazelnuts and milk chocolate. Too bad it wasn't bottled at 46%, nevertheless (one of) my favorite bfyb! Very delicious!"
564,Benromach 10-year-old,"Excellent taste ,quite complex, masterfully balanced on the mouth. The sherry blends with juicy fruits, the dry wood smoke is very well integrated in the whole oily profile, and fine leather notes along with orange peels add a more mature and old school air.Maybe the best value for money whisky of the year 2021."
565,Benromach 10-year-old,"I hope they only changed the label!smoky and slightly ashy, shoe polish, raw wool, some dried fruitsyep, still very nice. The smoke is moderate on the palate, the sherry influence a little stronger here. Roasted nuts, fresh figs, a little caramel. Tobacco, leather.medium in length, Oranges, very clean."
566,Benromach 15-year-old,"The Benromach 15 Years is as good if not better than when it was first introduced five years ago.Praise be! There's that Benromach profile I've come to expect and love! It has that classic soft barbecue smoke and grilled bacon aspect, but with lots of dried red fruits and hints of chocolate. There are some shy touches of citrus, grilled nectarine and pineapple too. A surprising hint of mint as well as a quick hit of tobacco leaves. Benromach at the top of its game.Quite oak-y and dry. It has some fruity aspects, like red apples and plums, but also there's also cocoa powder, a soft touch of smoke and cracked black pepper corns. Just a touch of eucalyptus.Sherried, fruity and spicy. Drying and medium in length."
567,Benromach 15-year-old,"Do you like dirty whiskies with a lot of character? Earthy. Little sour. Tiny bit of funk. Dry. Dark chocolate. Slightest touch of eucalyptus. Chocolate bitter orange. Leather. Cigar. Then back to the sour, earthy, funk. It’s like a dirty Mortlach meets a teenaged Springbank with a hearty dash of 20+ year sherried Ben Nevis thrown in. These are all of my favorites in one spot. I think I would rate this whisky higher in a blind review. This won’t be for everyone but if you like the characterful whiskies listed above you will like this. The 15 is better than the 21. The 21 suffers from too much dilution in a relatively more fragile whisky and comes across as bland as a result.For €70, I will never be without this or a similar Benromach in my cabinet. Single cask Benromachs just shot to the top of my wish list. I offer a round of applause and raise a glass to G&M / Benromach for making a truly individualistic whisky. Well done!"

569,Benromach 15-year-old,"The first time I've had this Benromach in my glass. The smell has something of smoked bacon, dark fruits and a note of maple syrup and vanilla. A slight hint of mint. Overall very interesting.Red fruits, spicy and a gentle smoke. The body is not quite as strong due to the 43%, but a nice drinking strength. I would have liked it a bit better at 46%, but overall very well balanced.The finish is longer than I would have expected, the smoke settles nicely and lingers. There is a bit of woody spice and vanilla sweetness. From the initial odor profile to the finish, a very varied dram. I like it!!"

571,Benromach 15-year-old,"1655) Benromach, 15YO (Bottled 2020)Dull slogan, why have one if it is meaningless? But an opinion that entirely personal, and no disrespect to all the craftman working in the distilleries.N- What's important lies in the bottle, as the initial heather honey smokes teases the nose, the toffee, liquorice and natural forest mist drawing in slowly with mold-y, but nice fragrant of damp wood. Peppers awaken as it aired longer, stewed red apple with restrained scents of savoury oxidized sherry odor, sweet resin underlying dried fruit that induce it to a desired level of depth. (87/21)P- Firm and full texture, nutty and chocolaty sherry arrives with warm heather honey smokes over aged and elegant leathery notes. (87/21)F- Medium long, silky, waxy, herbal-y bitter and cola syrup lead to medium dry mouthfeel. Savoury sweet undertones that took awhile to shows, but worth the wait. (89/22)B/B- 88/22Weighted Rate- 86pt"
572,Benromach 15-year-old,"Soft, pleasant, mint-fruity aroma gives way to a tanned, rather bitter taste and a short, nondescript finish. Ambiguous release. Too poor and unbalanced for a 15 year old. Doesn't match the price."
573,Benromach 15-year-old,"Nose: The slight smoke is a bit like hay, exotic spices, hops, citrus, red dates, malt, vanilla cream cake, and a blend of aromas. Drink: Full-bodied and soft, dried ginger, preserved fruit, chocolate."
574,Benromach 15-year-old,
575,Benromach 15-year-old,"Benromach 15 years, 43% alc. Original bottling (2021). Maturation: first-filled bourbon and sherry barrels Nose: My first association is dirty. Charred tobacco, wood ash and roasted nuts, peat smoke. This is followed by cocoa and paprika powder, some black pepper and milk chocolate. A sweetness develops with a mixture of light honey aromas and dark berries. Nice complex nose. Palate: First creamy and then dry very quickly, almost salty. The nuts are back, salted pistachios and malt, plus pleasant fruit aromas. Baked apples, still slightly unripe banana, pepper in dark chocolate. The sweetness is holding back. Finish: Medium to long, almonds, walnuts and malt, with oak and mild smoke aromas. Conclusion: A Benromach the way I love it, complex and dirty, yet wonderfully harmonious and also enjoyable without any deeper analysis. A whisky for every evening at a very high level. 87/100 points (2021). www.notesofmalt.com"
576,Benromach 21-year-old,"Nose: First of all, it is difficult to cope with this enormous load of aromas. The Benromach pours extremely full from the 1920's Blenders glass and the first thing that strikes you immediately are ripe oranges. But also apples in the form of applesauce, dark grapes, vanilla sauce, milk chocolate, cinnamon, dust, wet wood, sweet dates and, over time, cream. The otherwise typical smoke stays very discreetly in the background, but is always subliminally involved. Taste: Still voluminous and pleasantly powerful for 43% vol. Again, the oranges are in the foreground and are now accompanied by more intense smoke, red apple, cinnamon, freshly ground black pepper, cane sugar, Earl Gray, milk chocolate, and now something hearty, like bouillon (umami). On the tongue, the expected sweetness fades into the background and gives way to spicy, woody aromas. Finish: Long, spicy, woody and pleasantly dry with dark chocolate, orange zest and a hint of mint. Conclusion: Not a snap at around 140 €, but worth the money without any ifs or buts. I'm sure a bit biased because I think the distillery is great. Nevertheless, I think this bottling is absolutely successful and I am a little annoyed that my bottle is already empty after the division. A completely different topic, however, is the question of whether the price jump from 60-70 € compared to the 15 yo is justified. I have to say there is nothing like the 15-year-old. However, if you prefer something a bit more exclusive, the Benromach 21 is definitely the right choice."
577,Benromach 21-year-old,"The Benromach 21 Years shows an entire new side of this distillery.So extremely elegant yet rich. Oranges, milk chocolate, leather and tobacco leaves, with just a tinge of triple sec. Subtle whispers of fudge, damp oak and a very gentle barbecue note. Finally just a whisper of honey and some intriguing umami notes.Creamy mouthfeel. The oak is quite dominant, without veering over the edge. Somewhat dry with a tinge of black pepper and breakfast tea, but also fudge, brown sugar and orange peel. Whispers of menthol and earthy smoke.Somewhat oaky with gentle spices and citrus peels. Medium in length."
578,Benromach 21-year-old,"Coming up: Benromach 21y & Benromach 15y. How does the new 21er compare to the delicious 15er. Is double the price justified ...Benromach 21y: Very diacetyl-heavy, buttery caramel, walnut, orange oil, sweet sherry aromas, dry oak spice, cinnamon, marzipan, baked apple, milk chocolate, a nuance of smoke Benromach 15y: Vegetable, hay, cornflowers, thyme, the sherry aromas are weaker than those of the 21st, fresh oak, light smoke, mineral, cocoaBenromach 21y: sweet wood spice, buttery bitter orange, milk coffee, dried cranberries, beautifully woven light smokiness, sweet and spicy sherry Benromach 15y: Sour cherries, softwood, cinnamon, medium smoky note, apples, nice bourbon sherry mixBenromach 21y: bittersweet, slightly furry, sour sherry note, medium length Benromach 15y: sweet campfire smoke, tobacco, milk coffee, long and pleasant Conclusion : 2 very different whiskys, both nevertheless with the typical distillery character. The 21er has the larger proportion of sherry and is deeper, more elegant and hardly smoky. The 15er is wilder, more vegetal and scores with the finish. 21er 89 P / 15er 88 P I think the price of the 21 is justified because it is a lot more elegant."
579,Benromach 21-year-old,"Too soft and expensive to actually buy a bottle, but it's the kind of whisky that I would love to find on a menu when traveling (on a plane or train, preferably late at night).Just extremely mellow and relaxed, not worth racking your brains over, but complex enough to provide some lovely liquid company.This is a supremely mellow, laid-back and settled-down, generously sherried nose, with lots of old-age charm, but it has to be said: there's certainly a bit of sulphur involved (gunpowder, firecrackers). Lots of spices: cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg and perhaps even an idea of spicy red curry powder. Wild honey, bramble jam, liquorice, coffee, and a vegetal touch (mashed potatoes and beetroots). The smoke is there, leathery and earthy, but it's (again:) super mellow and reduced. I have to say I'm surprised by the overall intensity; this does not feel weak at 43%. As far as the nose goes, this is my favorite Benromach yet.[Edit: after leaving the 5 cl sample bottle half full/empty for a about three weeks, the sulphuric aromas have vanished almost completely, so I guess a full-size bottle would behave similarly.]Indeed slightly sulphuric to start with, then the red fruits appear, then the smoke and the spices, with a lot of leather and coffee and chocolate as an underlying theme. A splash of citrus accompanies everything throughout. Bit of a fizzy, pseudo-carbonated mouthfeel (ginger beer?), which is weird. Very pleasant, but it really is criminally underpowered at 43% and, as a consequence, a bit flat and not super complex.[Edit: on the palate, the sulphur is still clearly noticeable, even after three weeks of aeration.]Plenty of oak spices, which comes as no surprise given the typical Benromach first-fill recipe. Peat smoke, dark chocolate, leather, and liquorice. Pretty long despite the low ABV."
580,Benromach 21-year-old,"Very tasty, this Benromach. Uncomplicated - not overly complex - but well done. Would I want to spend 100+ on a whole bottle? Certainly not, but I like the sample. The note of braised red small apples reminds me a little of the Benriach 25.Apple and cinnamon rolls, fruit slices with dried figs, a touch of local herbs (lovage, rosemary) and old brass handles.Very smooth (this should only be understood positively in the sense of elegant understatements). Braised apples with honey.A little wood smoke, a little grapefruit and slightly astringent now shows the age."
581,Benromach 21-year-old,"Malt, roasted nuts and subtle, fine smoke, oily and old schoolWow, my best benromach to date. Thick with jam with strawberries and orange juice, syrupy sugar, vanilla, malt and light smoke. There are also fruits and it combines almost perfectly. Great part and tastes like the long gone Malta. Keep it up I like it. TopThe taste fades and the sweetness remains. No pepper or anything spicy. great"
582,Benromach 21-year-old,"Beautiful whisky that 3% would have done well. The 43% is particularly noticeable in the finish.Malt, Oami, date sweetness, orange, fig, vanilla and lots of apples. The smoke can only be heard from a distance. The nose is very full and complex.Orange peel, multivitamin juice, applesauce and light cloves. The taste still brings a bit of a raisin aroma with it. The sherry influence can be clearly felt, the smoke is just very delicate. Minimal bitterness comes towards the end. The mouthfeel is full despite the 43% assumedThe finish is unfortunately only of medium length, here it lacks the percentages."
583,Benromach 21-year-old,"An initially slightly tangy, then fruity-sweet flowery substance that actually has a unique selling point. This sweet taste, which turns into a finish with lavender and violet and leaves a hint of super unleaded - I don't yet know how to find it. Do i need a whole bottle? At this price rather no"
584,Benromach 21-year-old,"My first impression of the nose is that it is a little muted and while the palate is pretty tasty it fades too quickly.It does improve as you go on but the palate is a little light, if the flavours had more depth then it would hit 90 points but the average score by other members is spot on at around 87 points."
585,Benromach 21-year-old,"Pleasant surprise, very nicely balanced sweetness, good nose, satisfying dram!"
586,Bladnoch 10-year-old  Celebrating 200 Years,"This is a comparative tasting of the 10 and 11 year old bourbon matured bottlings from 2018 and 2020 (WIDs 113367 and 166633, respectively). Long story short, both are outstanding bottlings (for their age) on the nose and the palate, but the 10-year-old crashes and burns on the finish due to (what I perceive as) some musty/moldy wood. I've retried it on multiple occasions to make sure, and it's unmistakably tainted. The 11-year-old is clean, though, and therefore vastly superior. 55 € for an 11 y.o. at drinking strength may seem like a lot, but I think it's justified in light of the quality on display here.The 10 could easily pass for an unpeated Glen Scotia. It has that certain funky mustiness (somehow pleasantly sour/lactic), plus some damp wood. But, it has to be said, it's also an overachiever for its age, with an extremely rich and creamy and fruity ex-bc nose that seems a good deal older than ten years. I get yellow fruits (sour plums, apricots), grimy hessian, packed dirt floor, old and slightly musty wood as well as some beeswax and olive oil. There's also something indistinctly herbal, maybe juniper? It's an all-bourbon nose, but I'd say it's more autumnal than summery, if that makes sense. Impressive! 87 points. The 11 incorporates a similar funk, but generally comes across as somehow ""cleaner"" and better composed – the oak in particular seems more crisp. This leaves more room for the waxiness / oiliness and a citric side (grapefruit, lime, kiwi) that the darker, dirtier wood influence of 10 apparently smothered over. Definitely also beeswax here, while the oiliness may go more toward sunflower oil and a lovely dustiness (old wine cellar or attic, but not a damp one). This, too, seems older than its age statement. Certainly propelled by some really good ex-bourbon barrels and hoggies, but I wouldn't call it cask-dominated. The oak is never peppery or herbal or tart or any other word that comes to mind when there's over-the-top first-fill action going on. Instead it's just creamy and sweet and oily. An outstanding nose for an 11-year-old! I prefer it to the 10 and am tempted to go to 88 points on the nose.The 10: Creamy and oily mouthfeel right from the get-go. Nicely sweet as well, like a bourbon minus the overactive oak. It's only halfway through that some fruity acidity and more pepper enter into the mix. Here you get something like redcurrant or kiwi alongside some white pepper and grated ginger. The last third belongs to the wood, and this curious funk that reminds me of Glen Scotia. Which wouldn't be bad in and by itself, but after a few sips the cumulative impression is that there are indeed some substandard, musty barrels that have found their way into this vatting. I had the palate at 86 initially, but I'm subtracting a point for the weird woodiness at the end. So, 85 points.The 11: Acidic, yet simultaneously creamy/waxy start, then the oils keep building and reaching all through the flavor development. Oscillates back and forth between creamy/waxy/oily and fruit/citric on the tongue. Man, what a texture! I am again seriously and pleasantly surprised. Flavorwise, you get maize, golden syrup, sour/sweet yellow stone fruits, buttered and salted popcorn, chamomile tea, shortbread, and vanilla crescents. Crazy good, 88 points again.The 10: Yeah, there's something wrong with the oak, sadly enough. For me, it ruins the experience and depresses the score below the 70 mark. Too bad, otherwise this was a great bottling. But it has to be said that I'm sensitive in this regard and have, in the past, ""disqualified"" bottlings for their moldy oak that other aficionados have found totally okay. So whether or not you can get on board with this finish might depend on your taste in oak flavor. For me, this moldy note makes for 69 points at most.The 11: Not insanely long, but certainly more pronounced than it would have any right to be, considering the age. Waxy, with mellow bourbon sweetness and still some ripe apricot. Just enough spiciness at the end to make for a pleasant tingle, but not an outright burn. The bourbon casks drive it, yet there is no overt oakiness or questionable wood influence. Super oily. Leaves a slightly salty film on the lips. Really impressive – and really good – again. 87 points."

Mild tannins, grapefruit and a touch of roasted bread mark the medium-length finish. A fine summer dram which is far from being a lightweight!RATING: 3.7/5.0 stars ≙ 85 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE [+]"

591,Bladnoch 10-year-old  Celebrating 200 Years,"Been curious about this one, so thanks to karloff for the sample.Lowland and 10YO doesn't really sound too interesting, but this one over performs on every level.There are some truly great qualities to the basic distillate that must have been ignored by many that have rated this.Lots of yellow/orange fruit notes.Right after the pour there is a very noticeable sour-sweet smell to it. Strangely this ""evaporates"" rather quickly in the glass, giving way to more clear fresh citrus notes.Faint woody vanilla. Wafts of candy apple.Creamy, almost fat mouthfeel on arrival.Sweet fresh citrus.Spice and ABV is presented at a level where it is ready to enjoy, who in their right mind would mess with this?Delightfully light and sweet, balanced by moderate spice so it doesn't appear neither queasy nor boring.The fresh citrus continues into a medium length finish.So fresh that it reminds me a bit of a lemon/menthol mouth wash."
592,Bladnoch 10-year-old  Celebrating 200 Years,"with water:  sweet, cereal, vanilla, and very strong plum. You think you have a plum brandy. I did not have that so far.with water  sweet, not aggressive, round. The alcohol is well integrated. Then something bitter on the tongue. Very easy to feel the oak. Here comes the plum again, though not as strong as in the nose. But you have the impression of drinking a whisky Obstler.with water  long finish. This sweet bitterness remains on the tongue. Feeling very little of the oak flavor. Astringent. A musty note to the end.  In conclusion: tastes like licked on the bitter damp musty oak barrel in which previously plum brandy was in it."
593,Bladnoch 10-year-old  Celebrating 200 Years,"This whisky immediately appealed to me. It has a certain uniqueness that I didn't encounterd before with it's quirky fruitiness and flowers. Bourbon casks work for Bladnoch, no need for exotic (Australian) wine cask finishes like the other official bottlings!Banana, dried apricot, bergamot and vanilla cream. Associating more loosely I get haribo candy and even some baby vomit. An unusual but rather beautiful nose!Lively and clear: grassy and some flowers, jasmin tea, apple, banana and whipped cream. Some nutmeg and a slight saltiness appear after a while.Banana milkshake, orange and star fruit, followed by spcies like nutmeg and cinnamon. A bit more restrained compared to the palate."
594,Bladnoch 10-year-old  Celebrating 200 Years,"If Goldilocks drank whisky, this would probably be it. Not too much of this and not too much of that, it's just right. As far as Lowland whisky stake goes, this is their trump card. A real gem and everyone should have it behind their bar.This is like Spring in a glass, fragrant and full of fruit.Orange, apricot, peach, banana and golden delicious apple. Vanilla, refresher sweet, the one that had sherbet in the middle. This really should be nosed outdoors to appreciate it a bit more.Delicate sweet and spicy citrus as it says on the bottle, can't argue with that. Refreshing and creamy on the palate, this really is a treat for the taste buds. To be honest I could drink this all day and everyday. Again the 46.7% is bang on and why wouldn't it be.Absolutely no water needed and i don't care what Dave Broom says.A medium finish and that citrus spice really comes into it's own and as it fades it's almost willing you to pour another glass."
595,Bladnoch 10-year-old  Celebrating 200 Years,"Not a great spirit. It reminds me of Jura and Glen Scotia, nothing like the typical grassy profile that Bladnoch used to be known for.First it's all about cheese.

605,Bladnoch 11-year-old  2021 Release,
606,Bladnoch 11-year-old  2020 Release,"This is a comparative tasting of the 10 and 11 year old bourbon matured bottlings from 2018 and 2020 (WIDs 113367 and 166633, respectively). Long story short, both are outstanding bottlings (for their age) on the nose and the palate, but the 10-year-old crashes and burns on the finish due to (what I perceive as) some musty/moldy wood. I've retried it on multiple occasions to make sure, and it's unmistakably tainted. The 11-year-old is clean, though, and therefore vastly superior. 55 € for an 11 y.o. at drinking strength may seem like a lot, but I think it's justified in light of the quality on display here.80 points for the 10-year-old; 88 for the 11-year-old.The 10 could easily pass for an unpeated Glen Scotia. It has that certain funky mustiness, plus some damp wood. But, it has to be said, it's also an overachiever for its age, with an extremely rich and creamy and fruity ex-bc nose that seems a good deal older than ten years. I get yellow fruits (sour plums, apricots), grimy hessian, packed dirt floor, old and slightly musty wood as well as some beeswax and olive oil. It's an all-bourbon nose, but I'd say it's more autumnal than summery, if that makes sense. Impressive! 87 points. The 11 incorporates a similar funk, but generally comes across as somehow ""cleaner"" and better composed – the oak in particular seems more crisp. This leaves more room for the waxiness / oiliness and a citric side (grapefruit, lime, kiwi) that the darker, dirtier wood influence of 10 apparently smothered over. Definitely also beeswax here, while the oiliness may go more toward sunflower oil and a lovely dustiness (old wine cellar or attic, but not a damp one). This, too, seems older than its age statement. Certainly propelled by some really good ex-bourbon barrels and hoggies, but I wouldn't call it cask-dominated. The oak is never peppery or herbal or tart or any other word that comes to mind when there's over-the-top first-fill action going on. Instead it's just creamy and sweet and oily. An outstanding nose for an 11-year-old! I prefer it to the 10 and am tempted to go to 88 points on the nose.The 10: Creamy and oily mouthfeel right from the get-go. Nicely sweet as well, like a bourbon minus the overactive oak. It's only halfway through that some fruity acidity and more pepper enter into the mix. Here you get something like redcurrant or kiwi alongside some white pepper and grated ginger. The last third belongs to the wood, and this curious funk that reminds me of Glen Scotia. Which wouldn't be bad in and by itself, but after a few sips the cumulative impression is that there are indeed some substandard, musty barrels that have found their way into this vatting. I had the palate at 86 initially, but I'm subtracting a point for the weird woodiness at the end. So, 85 points.The 11: Acidic, yet simultaneously creamy/waxy start, then the oils keep building and reaching all through the flavor development. Oscillates back and forth between creamy/waxy/oily and fruit/citric on the tongue. Man, what a texture! I am again seriously and pleasantly surprised. Flavorwise, you get maize, golden syrup, sour/sweet yellow stone fruits, buttered and salted popcorn, chamomile tea, shortbread, and vanilla crescents. Crazy good, 88 points again.The 10: Yeah, there's something wrong with the oak, sadly enough. For me, it ruins the experience and depresses the score below the 70 mark. Too bad, otherwise this was a great bottling. But it has to be said that I'm sensitive in this regard and have, in the past, ""disqualified"" bottlings for their moldy oak that other aficionados have found totally okay. So whether or not you can get on board with this finish might depend on your taste in oak flavor. For me, this moldy note makes for 69 points at most.The 11: Not insanely long, but certainly more pronounced than it would have any right to be, considering the age. Waxy, with mellow bourbon sweetness and still some ripe apricot. Just enough spiciness at the end to make for a pleasant tingle, but not an outright burn. The bourbon casks drive it, yet there is no overt oakiness or questionable wood influence. Super oily. Leaves a slightly salty film on the lips. Really impressive – and really good – again. 87 points."
607,Bladnoch 11-year-old  2020 Release,"The square bottle design is hilariously tacky. This truly is the fake Louis Vutton bag of whisky bottles. As a single malt, Bladnoch was alway able to deliver average to good Lowland style whisky provided it was put into good bourbon barrels and left alone. So I am happy to see a fully bourbon matured version, and also happy to report that this is indeed a good malt, unlike the wine tortured monstrosities that they’ve also bottled.The nose has vanilla and lemon, with a little honey as well. The palate adds warm oak spices and intensifies the lemon juice. A full Lowland style whisky - wonderful. Only Daftmill is and Rosebank was in the same ballpark - but both are much less obtainable.Dear people at Bladnoch, more like this please. And put it in a bottle I don’t want to hide."
608,Bladnoch 11-year-old  2020 Release,"Tastes good, everything is nicely interwoven and dense, but I like the 10 year old Bladnoch (2018) a little better because of his multi-layered nature.Very fruity, smells of fresh apples and apple compote at the same time. In the background flowery-floral, green grapes, slightly rancid. Something closed the whole thing. The alcohol is well integrated.Nice oak, apple (very present), vanilla.Light finish, medium-long, with beautiful oak notes."
609,Bladnoch 11-year-old  2020 Release,"It is always fascinating how much the nose and taste can differ from one another. While the nose here doesn’t invite you to relax and announces something weird, it is absolutely calm and balanced in the mouth, very tasty. Notes from a blind tasting. Very sensible to dilute it down so much that a barrel size would probably have been quite uncomfortable on the tongue. In any case, the price-performance ratio is okay.Light fruits and a little sweat right after pouring, also ammonia, but only in the first breath. After a while, ammonia again in the first breath, then again light fruits and mineral notes. Looks a bit musty. There is also a pinch of sulfur. Overall very closed. Half an hour later it finally seems a bit calmer and opens up a bit. The flavors are basically the same, only much more integrated. Somewhat darker sweetness joins it. Warmth of the hand finally opens it, but it mainly brings lactic acid, fermented windfalls, but also some chocolate. In addition, the alcohol is now biting heavily in the nose.The impression in the mouth is completely different. The alcohol is quite rough and strong, but the mouthfeel is rather thin, it can't be that much of it, rather weakly integrated, although this is very pleasant. Strong honey sweetness paired with light fruitiness and a little chocolate, that's really delicious! A handful of herbs are added in the second sip. A delicate acidity lays back around the palate.The finish is medium-long and rather sweet. However, it does not distribute much heat. In the second sip, the herbs initially dominate, a little liquorice, before it slowly ends sweetly."
610,Bladnoch 11-year-old  2020 Release,"Very good ex-bourbon whisky! The price is justified, if not a bargain.First: strong bourbon vanilla. Then light fruits like lychee, pear and apricot. Grassy, also some hay. Plus lemon in the background. Coherent and well rounded.Creamy, gentle start. In addition to the aromas that one had in the nose (the lemon pushes forward a bit), the oak is discreetly noticeable.Milk chocolate, light fruits and citrus with vanilla. Medium length."

With green labels with Muh and Mäh! Howl!"
618,Bladnoch 17-year-old  Celebrating 200 Years,"I got it for free to test. A heartfelt thank you goes out to the “little dram” for the big rehearsal. In this respect, I have nothing in common with Bladnoch. So it was a pleasure for me to sniff in there. Unfortunately I have to say that this kind of whisky is not mine. That reminds me too much of the Obstwasser character of the schnapps here on Lake Constance. Sorry, was just a thought ... just saying. What remains here is the thought of comparing it with the well-known brother of the same name, 7 years his junior. For this I hold back 2cl of it.Metallic, grape-heavy, it comes across as young and immature. Some malt and grain impose. Artificially floral notes float above it. The stinging of alcohol only goes away with water. Something seems artificial here. Wasn't the NEW MAKE SPIRIT high-quality enough? I think the finish was a must! Seen in this way, the nose is too strongly influenced and not sufficiently complex in its own right. The search for character.This Obstwasser effect fades out whether the texture has sufficient depth at the beginning. All in all, it makes a full impression, but at the transition it immediately becomes woody and alcoholic, drying and even slightly bittersweet. The barrel experience of 17 years of maturation is missing at this point. Only the artificially floral sweet note from the wine finish now remains in the background as an overall impression. Also rather a bit perfume-heavy. I am satisfied with the texture in the transition. But you also have to like it bitter.Medium to short. With this bitter impression, you go to the exit pretty quickly. It's a shame, because the 17 years have the potential to give a little magic of joy with 46.7% ABV at the end. My feeling now tells me that the disadvantage of this dram started as a mediocre new make. It was too busy to save the situation in the bottle after 17 years. The mouth remains covered with this perfume note. Conclusion: not every finish works. That is shown here. Unfortunately, a 17-year-old experiment got out of hand and then a finish at an intermediate level."

632,Bladnoch Adela  Celebrating 200 Years,"Freshly uncorked: First a complex, very idiosyncratic single malt outside of the mainstream sherry cask maturation. You can feel the 15 years with lots of oak spice just as clearly as the dry, nutty aromas of the Oloroso-Casks. In addition, peculiar aromas that are reminiscent of Provencal herbal mixture with a touch of peppermint, slightly bitter almonds and a hint of sourness. With the second and third sip it gets better, now also creamy, fruity sweetness with dark chocolate and nicely combined with the oak flavor. Then positive development with increasing oxidation in the emptying bottle over a period of 4.5 months. Overall, a successful mixture of aged, oak wood with pleasantly integrated spices, not intrusive sweetness (dark chocolate with raisins and nuts) and the variety of flavors of good Oloroso casks. However, it is no longer worth its price."
633,Bladnoch Adela  Celebrating 200 Years,"Bladnoch Adela 15yo, 46.7%. Consumed Aug 2021.Amber orange. Aroma suggests burnt dried orange rind and biscuits. Touch of apple. Faint nutmeg. Eggnog. The subtlest possible note of nail varnish. All pretty muted. Taste is spicy and compact up front, becoming milky, the middle section starts building a saltiness and the finish and linger are softly oaky. Quite a milky muddled middle to this dram. Ever so slightly vegetal in the oak character, like a very subtle spinach note. But that fades and this is primarily a clean dram, if a bit milky and gloopy to start, helped by the bite of salt and pepper in the finish. Becomes increasingly dry and peppery, which is nice and leads to this growing on me quite a lot. A perfectly decent dram that I would happily drink no problem but which doesn't offer enough to persuade me to buy a bottle. This is good though. 3 425/82"

I don't yet know what to think of whether it is inconsistent or skillful to mix old and young instead of aggressively marketing the young. So he is not meat or fish and in many ways too young and unbalanced. But also not undrinkable and sometimes with nice accents.

A lot of mild apples, sweetish without any acid, a hint of vanilla, oats and orange zest. Palate: A lot of character is added here. Sweet and fruity with apple and pear, a splash of lemon, then stronger. Roasted almonds, cocoa, oak and colored pepper, some white coffee with a creamy texture. Finish: rather short, light and creamy. I would say sweet. A mild dryness with a slightly spicy character remains. Conclusion: The proportion of the still very young barrels is clearly visible, they give the Vinaya a fresh and mild character. At the same time, the alcohol is wonderfully integrated, no corners or edges. A pleasant representative of the Lowlands. 82/100 points (2021). www.notesofmalt.com"

662,Blair Athol 12-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"Seems significantly older than 12 years. Generously sherried, with plenty of dark / caramelized / roast / burnt aromas and quite some twiggy, tart wood, and even a very faint smoky aspect (akin to Cragganmore 12, perhaps). Nice chalky, mineralic notes as well, and the pleasant raisin-y aroma of a freshly opened pack of filter cigarettes. That being said, it's very thin and I almost feel like I can taste the caramel colorant (this is more orange than Donald). Surprisingly little fruit for a Blair Athol. All in all, still very good. If you're into the darker, espressso-like side of whisky, you'll gobble this up."

The departure unfortunately disappointed something.Immediately heavy, dense sherry, cane sugar and a vinous note. After a little service life set very fresh, the attached wine note is now cleanly integrated. Candied fruits and a fat butteriness as well as bright fruits give a harmonious overall picture. Strong maltiness and pronounced acidity, like strong coffee when heated. In addition, floor wax and some damp leather. Completely warmed up, the nose is sparkling clean, buttery, heavy, sweet, kahlua, toffee, with dates and figs.also sweet and clean and very crowded, relatively late is the oak very pleasant. Honey, beet syrup and a hint of eucalyptus, some coffee. Slightly oily consistency.sounds sweet, the tannins do not last long. Here, too, overall only medium."
666,Blair Athol 12-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"I found this very similar to the review by The Drammer's Notes:Eye: The colour of the whisky is burnished. Nose: Lovely sherried nose with christmas cake aromas of dried fruits, apricots, raisins and dates, orange peel, walnuts, warm spices, cinnamon and vanilla, liquorice, cough syrup and leather.Palate: Full flavoured, rich and sweet with oranges, raisins, stewed plums, oak wood, sweet spices, cinnamon, star anise and nutmeg, sweet toffee, malty cereal, roasted almonds and red wine tannins.Finish: Rather long, turning drier with lingering spices, chilli, tannin and wood ash.Verdict: The Blair Athol 12 is a rather wonderful sherried single malt with plenty of christmas cake flavours and a luscious mouthfeel. It is slightly lacking in complexity but is none the less very well balanced for a 12 year old and seriously moreish, from a distillery that deserves a lot more attention that it gets.If this was unchillfiltered, and bumped up to 46%, this would have been an outstanding whisky, even with E150 added.https://whiskytastings.tumblr.com/post/151627759333/review-163-blair-athol-12-43-abv-e150a"

Medium, cool smoke with fine sweetness, dark chocolate, a hint of dark berries (blackberry, elderberry), a hint of walnut.  Of course there is still no elegance and the most intense is not 40%, but you can tell what's going to happen later."
669,Bowmore 10-year-old  Dark & Intense,"A vinous earth, crushed grapes, wood chips. The smoke and peat are muted, a bit dusty, the sherry is darker and deeper than usual. Nice balance. A hint of honey, which really awakens in the mouth. It's light, a little peppery, earthy and maderized. The liquor must be kept in the mouth for a while for it to reveal itself, with apricot, grapes and plum. Quite strong finish, not too short, dry earth, hints of smoke, charcoal in retro-olfaction. At less than 40 euros, it's a bargain. https://ilikesky2020.blogspot.com/2020/06/bowmore-10-yo-dark-intense.html"
670,Bowmore 10-year-old  Dark & Intense,"Basically a sherry-heavy Bowmore as I like it. Unfortunately, it was diluted too much with the 40%, so that, contrary to its nickname, it lacks the intensity and power of the aromas.

674,Bowmore 10-year-old  Dark & Intense,"Typical Bowmore start in the nose. Honey and a burning campfire. A date sweet. Dried seaweed, but moderate smoke that almost smells like old, slightly musty cardboard towards the end. The smoke is perceived more strongly in the taste and goes in the direction of smoked meat. A weak citrus or grapefruit note accompanies the dried fruit from the sherry barrel. Not very complex and extensive. Finish: The peat smoke lingers gently. The plum dried fruit sensations go downhill in record time. Mild sweetness to say goodbye and therefore generally pleasant to drink in a hurry. The ""intense"" hum from the name is of course noticeably missing in the finish. A Bowmore that you don't have to have. Pleasant in the throat, but quickly disappeared. With the multitude of Bowmores tasted so far, will I remember that of all people?"

677,Bowmore 12-year-old,"Of all Islay distilleries, Bowmore is the oldest but arguably the most uninteresting. Their 12-year-old expression is intensely colored (E150a) and less peated than other Islay Single Malts. The nose is distinctly earthy with fresh vegetables, citrus fruits and an occasional alcoholic burn. A warming glow accompanies the arrival, while the peatiness is more restrained and yet somewhat unique. Sweet spices, dried fruits and herbal notes lead to a rather dry finish with hints of bitter chocolate. This whisky might be worth a try but it lacks intrinsic quality.RATING: 3.0/5.0 stars ≙ 79 pts → AVERAGE"
678,Bowmore 12-year-old,"Cool, rather delicate, with the aroma of burnt aspen wood chips, apple peel, dried fruits with pepper and black tea, taste with bitterness with nuances of bitterly burnt branches, prunes and tightly brewed tea, medium-long finish, malt-smoky with black pepper.  Not very interesting, but honest basic malt from Bomor. Although he is only 12, but let him breathe well, the aroma is quite closed.  RATING: 82pts - [n21, t20, f20, b21] → | 80-82: Ordinary |"
679,Bowmore 12-year-old,"Quite possibly the worst named and age-stated Islay single malt out there.Extinguished campfire, sour salt, flattened citrus, faded vanilla, wet cardboard. Malt husks!Exactly the same as the nose, plus a deceptive hint of heavily spent sherry that disappears as soon as you think you've found it. You think it's there, but it's not really there at all.Medium, spicy, charred barrel, hints of sherry. This is actually the best part of the whole experience. Not a bad finish.Final thoughts: in a blind tasting I would never guess this is an Islay. This smells and tastes like one of those no-name releases from some island they won't tell you about, because they're too ashamed to admit they dug this stuff up in an abandoned warehouse that nobody wanted anymore. Given this is actually an official bottling of a 12-year-old single malt from Islay, this is simply a complete disaster and even an embarrassment - yes, I'm going that far with this! Have you tried McClelland's Islay? This here is the same thing, except it's 12 years old. Did you know that Bowmore actually produces McClelland's Islay? Which is all you should need to understand that they no longer care about their reputation. They just want to spend less and sell more. A real shame to see an Islay distillery fall this low. If you're wondering, my bottling is from 31.08.21. I was curious if I got a bad batch or something, so I did some research and found an interesting review of Bowmore's 12, 15 and 18 single malts on Malt Review, back from August 2020. Unsurprisingly, they were all rated 3/10. Shame!"
680,Bowmore 12-year-old,"First Bowmore 12 I've had in probably 10 years. As I was only just exploring beyond standard expressions at the time this was a pretty solid experience back then.Currently I find this somewhat underwhelming and forgettable. It smells and tastes of a wet extinguished camp fire. Also a sour note (not citrussy but something fermenting). A short charcoaly finish, that's about it. Had a Laproaig 10 afterwards and although that's also bottled at a mere 40%, it's definitely more enthralling."

683,Bowmore 12-year-old,"""The Mystery of Peat"" could be the name of a new theology theory based upon this whisky: it's his secret and if you don't know it's there you can't feel it, but once you savored every simple element this whisky has it comes out, like a scenographer at the end of his play showing himself, doing a bow, and getting his own applause.Malt and strong strong cider, some leather and wax - smells of ""classic"" and of new home furniture. Doesn't give you the feeling it needs a second thought; just takes you to your first sip. A little later some vanilla and raisins side up with the previous giants, all mixed up in a nice balance - citrus is the main character, malt is its trusty companion, the sweet notes make the surroundings.As I said before, medicinal smoke comes out at the end of the glass.Medium consistency. Begins with sweet vanilla on the tip of your tongue, which then gets surrounded by woody feeling and again, strong citrus at the back of your mouth. Some chocolate also, you can feel a hint of it if you make some whisky dash on your palate. Some salty feeling at the end of the glass.Middle length with strong wood followed by raisins and notes of vanilla, citrus, sponge cake. Some sweet flavours mix with the woody ones and give you a nice caramel. Then peat - at the end of your glass you can get it, that character has been reciting in this play for the whole time, pulling strings, exalting all the other characters..."
684,Bowmore 12-year-old,"Nose:Medicinal at first, Citrus / Oranges, peat smoke, fennel, anise, vanilla and some ash.Taste:For me again the medicinal note comes first, after that its sugar sweet, with peat smoke, salmiak and licorice, in the development the citrus note comes back and there also is a little mint note.Finish:Not very long, and brings nothing new.All in all, better than expected. "

Great fruity-spicy aroma play, I like it very much, but could be smoky. Soft, oily and round in the mouth with slightly acidic notes, but mostly fruity and spicy with notes of tobacco. In the finish, there is then a decent gush of dark chocolate, which covers the remaining aromas. Behind it a delicate trail of smoke. Length: 6/10 Great, intense, sherry-heavy malt that is relatively tame for Islay. Overall, I like it very much, the color and the slightly low alcohol content only slightly detract from the impression. Grade: 2+"
688,Bowmore 15-year-old,"For the current price of around € 55, you get a very good sherry malt with smoke support. From the nose to the finish, it doesn't fall off. The 43% are pleasant and are completely sufficient for a nice drinking pleasure. In the nose I would have found a similarity to the Benromach 15y. However, in terms of taste, I find the Bowmore stronger on the smoke side and therefore more complex.The 15 year old malt shimmers with a dark amber color in the glass. Some tears move slowly, almost oily, down the edge of the glass. Full nose right from the start. Nice combination of a not too strong, slightly ashy smoke together with a typical sherry aroma - dark dried red fruits. After a few minutes, the fruit component changes in the nose to more sour aromas of red juicy apples and also a hint of caramel. Maybe it's due to the smoke, but behind the sweet fruit / caramel mix, you can now also feel some leather and tobacco.Nice start despite ""only"" 43% alcohol content. Soft, creamy mouthfeel. The smoke becomes more oily and, together with the peat, is much more present than in the nose. Furthermore a very nice combination with the fruit aromas from the sherry maturation and the sweetness of the caramel. The apples from the smell are no longer active in the mouth. The oak begins to show itself with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.Smoke is clearly noticeable in the mouth the entire time. The sweetness is now complemented in the finish by a pleasant bitterness of the oak. Dark chocolate and light tobacco notes stay in the mouth for a long time, along with the smoke."

As I usually like sherry BA, but dislike peat, this should be interesting! This final whisky of the very pleasant box, pours quite a bit darker than most of these. Dark, 'old gold' copper. Scent is surprisingly light on the peated side. More like a whiff of smoke, than a blast of peat. Fairly strong wood presence, notes of vanilla, dry touch (nutty) by the oloroso are mildly present. In the mouth, immediately the density takes a lot of attention. The first aroma's are very strong, rough wood (positive!) . Drying from the sherry. very full flavored.

Still warm ash, again a lot of lemon and honey sweetness, now strong vanilla, the finish is dominated by the warm smoke and vanilla, only later in the medium-long finish comes again the salty-maritime character. Despite 15 years almost no oak noticeable (just a touch of bitterness).  Very pleasing whisky for the crowd. A good Bowmore but hardly challenging the experienced Whsiky connoisseur.

In the background I discover a maritime note (salt), minimal hints of tobacco and leather as well as a little oak wood. The alcohol (43%) is very well integrated and not noticeable.The texture of the Bowmore is oily and very soft. Full-bodied spread many red fruits (especially cherries), grapefruit, dark chocolate and smoke. The smoke is now more intense to unfold and contrasts beautifully with the sweet and fruity sherry notes. Vanilla, caramel, delicate hints of tropical fruits, tobacco, leather and spicy oak notes follow. A salty sea breeze lays like a thin veil over the other flavors. Very harmonious, without corners and edges.Medium to long, fruity-spicy and smoky. Fruity-sweet berries and sherry notes are slowly disappearing.

717,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"[June, 2017]  Several years ago I had my last Bowmore 18-years old and found it rather weakish (83 points).  So it is time for a re-taste and when I found this offer of two bottles for 99 Euro I could not resist.  This review is on batch L172067.This is a great batch and my willingness to buy two bottles (of course after a small tasting sip) paid off.  So look out for batch L172067 if you like this profile...The colour is auburn and the texture shows very late slow legs and tears. The nose is quite winey and it seems to me that they added some wine cask maturations (Bordeaux or the like) to this batch. I like that! Besides this there are the typical sherry aromas (raisins, dark chocolate), toffee (from bourbon casks) and some peat smoke too.The taste confirms my guess of several different winey flavours (please keep this recipe, Bowmore!) and it is nicey balanced between the different wines, smoke and wood. And it is layered - a sign of great depth.The dram arrives warming and coating on the palate with a minor bitter feeling (tannins) that is not unpleasant. The finish is very long, sweet and neither bitter nor drying. But nicely chocolatey and chewable. Water is not needed as it flattens the dram."
718,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"In a nutshell, this bottling is extremely tasty and tasty! Intensive sherry elements meet peat and sea, an interesting spicy note is the complete time dominant in the foreground. The oily creaminess of this bottling is impressive and although this malt shows many facets I miss the certain something or the certain ""buzz"" ;-). Still delicious and dangerous!The malt in the glass shines bright and clear. On the glass wall sticks an oily and syrupy streaks from the isolated thick drops dissolve which relatively quickly search their way back into the glass. The nose is initially very restrained, slowly dissolving dark berries and creamy dark chocolate. Mild peat flavors mingled with a hint of cold smoke, the peat is more mineral, but is always traversed by fruity sweetness. Velvety vineyard peach and abrasion of orange peel show up, the dark chocolate is noticeably more dominant, here and there the alcohol makes itself felt with a slight tickling in the nose. Echoes of salt and sea breeze reveal the origin of this malts, the fruit flavors become darker and more complex. A touch of dark caramel and a subtle spicy note stimulate the salivation.Dark fruits in combination with an interesting spicy note dominate the first sip. A wide variety of flavors flow through the palate, dried raisins, old orange, dark chocolate, echoes of various spices make the taste buds explode. Dark chocolate melts on the tongue, a sip of hot espresso is added before dark and wooden sharpness lays over the tongue. A pinch of salt revives the basic character of the maritime, creamy chocolate and red berries rest in the mouth. Old walnut aroma rises and exudes a slightly bitter aroma, creamy and oily wood elements float under the tongue. A combination of tart and sweet fruit elements, chocolate and spicy wood is accompanied by a slightly oriental spice mixture.Creamy and oily rest the now tart aromas on the palate. Subtle sharpness heats more and more on the palate and tongue. A few grains of salt and some crushed pepper provide a certain basic sharpness, cold espresso and bitter dark chocolate for discreetly bitter elements and the dark fruits with their sweetness for the sweeter influences in the aftertaste. Spicy wood tones and dark walnut aroma revive the creaminess and thus round off the harmonious finish. For a long time the savory aromas are warming on the palate, these aromas slowly fade away leaving a creamy mouthfeel. The aforementioned spice note or spice mixture never seems to end."
719,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"In an attempt to better my impression of recent Bowmore I decided to try this 18YO right after finishing a very disappointing Gold Reef.Obviously colored and no doubt chill filtered, can it do the job?Appears to be a good value for an 18YO, but in the end you get what you pay for.The sherry notes are very nice, but if it is a full 18 years sherry maturation they seem kind of soft.Then again the wood notes points to good quality casks.Sweet dark fruit and berries. Some sour wine, dark and dusty furniture.There's peat, well integrated, almost hidden.It arrives with a rather thin and watery mouthfeel.Good chocolate note, coffee, leather, dark fruits.Then a significant build up of spice.I prefer a dram to arrive at it's most ""ferocious"" with the taste emerging from the alcohol. This is quite the opposit, starts with lots of rather nice flavors that all to quickly disappears in prickly spice.When the spice resides there's again notes of sweet black currant, other dark fruits and coffee. The wood gets a little dry. Peat reappears when inhaling."

721,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"Typical olorosoed Bowmore. Shows its age well and avoids becoming to heavy and cloying. Im not usually a big fan of this profile, but this bottle comes with a recommendation, if only for the nose which is brilliant in my opinion. Would have benefitted from 46% and an honest colour. Water improves the nose but takes a bit from the palate. Clear grab for under 80€Damp earth, raisins, rubber boots, kerosene, overripe oranges, bananas. After a while in the glass menthol appears alongside lemon bonbons, then some bacon - smoked obviously, cough syrup, semi dark chocolate.With water: milk chocolate and sweet fruit bonbons joins the fray.Sweet and bitter sherry, lemon juice, blood oranges, leather, pinewood, cooked figs and dates, slightly medicinal, paint, typical Bowmore peat profile.With water: pretty much the same, maybe a bit more citric and actually a bit less interesting.Dying on lemon juice, bitter peat, cranberryjuice, salt. Medium to medium-long."
722,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"Aroma: restrained, sherry components immediately appear: raisins, dried apricots, dates, fortified wine, some oriental sweets, dry grain, light wood smoke, mineral-metallic notes, oiled instruments, ash, sea water. Over time, sweet and sour berries appear, old grandmother's furniture, creaminess as if from a toffee. A slightly closed aroma, but complex and with development.  Taste: bright, prickly, red pepper, curry, various spices, dark raisins, salt, chalk, spicy wood, burnt berry jam, meat with toppings, tobacco leaf.  Finish: mineral ash, raisins, astringent peel of berries, ash, herbal bitter, a little pine needles, dark chocolate, pleasantly fading spices, medium length.  Rating: 89  Bottom line: an excellent 18 came out, with a dominant sherry barrel, very spicy in taste, you just do not expect such sharpness after such a delicate aroma. In some places you can even forget that this is peat whisky, it looks like something sherry from Highland, only light tones of ash, grill and sea return to Isla."
723,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"Very similar to the regular 18-year-old, but there are differences: this one is even more leathery, sweeter and syrupy, thanks to the PX influence, which, sadly, is beginning to swamp the distillate here. It's also sharper than the standard 18, with a little bite in the finish. So both smoother and rougher, if you will. A bit vulgar perhaps, but still a good winter/fireplace/Christmas malt."
724,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"Just after being poured into the glass, the sherry is essential and we think of blackberry liqueur. After a few minutes, the peat becomes stronger and stronger. It is woody, fruity, slightly medicinal. And also iodine, kelp. A delicately floral hue that is the Bowmore brand. Violet or rose. On the palate, it is a whirlwind of flavors, first of red fruit and very tender leather which combines with a racy peat, then honey and candied lemon, something slightly acidic like redcurrant or blueberries, spices, finally it's the finish, long, the peat rises and hits the table with its fist, a touch of earth, then the flowers which bloom in retro-olfaction, with woody reflections. https://ilikesky2020.blogspot.com/2020/06/bowmore-18-yp-deep-complex.html"
725,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"These new Bowmores are very good, surpringly not thin at 43%. 86/87.Big sherry. Cranberry, orange peel, milk chocolate, salted minerals, piquant spices and smoke. Touch of camphor.Creamy. Dried fruits, citruses, spicy oak, smoke and peat.Long, cocoa and smoke."
726,Bowmore 18-year-old  Deep & Complex,"Very tasty, pleasant smoke, old wood, light sweetness, long smoky aftertaste. Great duty free release"
727,Bowmore 25-year-old,"Smell: The wine is warm-bodied and approachable. The aged Chinese black tea leaves have purple-red juice on the bottom, and the faint smoky taste is like the fingers of a smoker. The overall sense of balance is highly integrated, and the touch of alcohol is a bit addictive. At the end, purple floral scents, such as lavender and violet, and fresh dragon fruit, remind me of a woman in a Chinese cheongsam, making tea quietly in front of me.  Drinking: Excellent wine body quality, full oiliness, and a taste that I call empty inspiration. People chew the wine while thinking about wow, the taste buds are wrapped in a lot of smoke, floral and fruity The fragrance blooms on the cheeks of the teeth, no shortcomings are remembered at all, and the end rhyme is slender.  Feeling: The smell is clear and expressive. All elements are working together to express a theme to you. Although richness is sacrificed, it will not be considered a shortcoming. The taste has an empty inspiration that I love very much, so I gave it a full score. If there are not too many comparison items in mind, this bottle of Bowmore 25 should not have any disadvantages."

729,Bowmore 25-year-old,"[November, 2018] I had this dram during a Jim McEwan tasting in Bonn and it was distilled shortly after he left this very fine distillery......and it is a weak 25-years old Bowmore. All previous editions I tasted so far were clearly better, so I advice to rather go for these at auctions than to buy this pricey bottle.The colour is russetmuscat and the nose offers a rather shy profile for a 25-years old Bowmore. Yes, it shows the typical fruity and peaty aromas but usually they are much stronger and more complex. This is a little disappointing...The taste is less fruity than I hoped for but shows more bitter-peaty flavours than usual (campfire smoke). It is very sweet mainly on sugars and neither complex nor impressive. A rather weak taste given its price tag! Water is not needed as it just flattens the dram.The initial mouthfeel is warming but not realy coating with a drying-bitter moment that is somewhat distracting (bitter tea, metals). The finish is short and adds no new impressions. It gets bitter-astringent towards the end, again."
730,Bowmore 25-year-old,"So in my opinion must be a smoky whisky: the smoke is present and clearly noticeable, without dominantly beat all other flavors. In addition, the alcohol perfectly completes the overall impression without burning or being too weak. A great balanced, complex, tasty whisky.Sure, right at the beginning smoke. Then sweetness, malt, caramel, oak, overripe apple, later grapefruit and vanilla. Coffee. The smoke is present all the time without covering the other flavors.sweet malt, increasing smoke and ashes. The alcohol is almost perfectly integrated.Also in the long finish the smoke, malt and distinct oak, but hardly bitterness. Citrus fruit. Leaves a creamy mouthfeel."
731,Bowmore 25-year-old,"nose: vegetal, smoky and spicy sweetness, on fresh malt, floral with rose petals more than violet mouth: smokier, fine peat, on the sweet stamens of a violet, on sweet exotic fruits too, slightly peppery spices amplify these scents the peat becomes maritime with a return of shells drying on the edge of a crate of a fishing boat the most is the sweetness and delicacy of these fine aromas which remain in the mouth despite the fairly low degree. final: on the same scents with fine peat, iodized spray and fruits with their stems, medium finish however and which is lost."
732,Bowmore 25-year-old,"Did not take any notes during my tasting.The infamous soapy / FWP / perfumy notes are noticeable from the nose to palate to the finish, with a good amount of smokiness and sherry influence. Overall it's just another water down, flat and weak OB Bowmore."

A nice entry for people who are not yet familiar with Islay whisky.The nose is sweet and fresh on vanilla, apples, grapes, lime (including zest) and lots of sea salt. A classic Bowmore if you ask me. The smoke is in the background, making it fresh and accessible. In that sense, it really reminds me of the Small Batch from a few years ago.I would not have minded a little bit more body. On the palate too, it is very fruity and sweet, while the peat is a lot more outspoken. It even flirts with tropical notes, which I quite like. Loads of vanilla too. Yes, again, I am reminded of the Small Batch.The finish is not very long, but with a lovely smokiness and a touch of mint. Vanilla and citrus remains present throughout."

In addition, sweet malt, a citrus fruit, hay, herbs and honey. Very nice.Oily and strong with caramel and malt. Nice, warm smokiness and again the herbs and the hay. A splash of lime and some milk coffee. Also interesting in taste.Here is a herbal tea mixture with pepper. Vanilla and caramel mix with spices and a pleasant smoky note.

This whisky had potential but it was bottled too early.

I loved the fresh tropical notes that really shined through thanks to the rum caskUnbelievably creamy, custard, bananas, well rounded.Just too one-dimensional, not much flavor apart from the tropical notes which persist mostly throughout the whisky.With water: A tad of pepper comes out.Probably the least impressive part of this whisky. All I got was a little woodiness and the slightest hint of vanilla.Medium short finish.With water: the woodiness becomes apparent, but there is nothing else going on.This gets 83 points from me which makes it nothing but an average whisky.

Think cinnamon, vanilla, crème brûlée, lemon tart and even a hint of pastry. This is almost a liquid dessert. But peated? Nothing much on the nose.Good body. Quite oily, almost creamy. Wonderfully sweet and very spice. Yes, on the palate, the peat is very prominent with a nice development of smoke. The sweetness of the nose returns – double time – but becomes darker all the while, if you know what I mean. It leans towards barbecue.The finish is medium long, sweet and warm.

Honey and vanilla sugar, Spices appear in the development, pepper and nutmeg. Green banana that is backed up with some gentle smoke.

Quite some Granny Smith apple as well. Very light and happy, but not much in terms of complexity, while it is less young than the ones I tried before. White chocolate. There is a hint of peated malt, but all the way in the back. Very clean.The body is light, but luckily not watery. Fresh and lively, but it feels quite young. Pears, apples, some citrus and again some peat, with makes for a soft smokiness. But very soft, mind you. The malt clearly shines through, including barley sugar. Some liquorice and white pepper give it a spicy base, but all in all this is a very light malt.The finish, medium in length, offers a mild spiciness and more white fruit.

There is also a smell of wet slightly composting crass cuttings.The peat mixes well with the fruit notes. It tastes almost like a sparkling white wine in some parts. Also it has a strong taste of wash beer with a squeeze of orange. This tastes quite young but that is fine. A medium finish with dried orange and sherbet dip."

Not my cuppa.Dark and sweet nose on rotting wood. Sounds awful, but kinda works in this case. Add some brown sugar as well as molded wood. There is also a big herbal side. Ferns, nettles, the sap of roots. A bit special, but not unpleasant. In the distance, I do get a touch of rubber that I do not fancy.  The body is rather light (almost watery in fact). Very sweet on apples, pears, lemon and lime juice. Ginger and liquorice. I find myself pulling faces, which is not a good sign. It has a peaty edge, meaning this one also is a mix of peated and unpeated barley. But the balance is off. It is somewhat raw and unpolished, if you know what I mean. The flavors don’t do each other any favors (note to self: you are not a poet). The finish is medium long, drying, smoky and sweet, but does make me long for a glass of water. "

But 80 EUR for a half liter bottle of 3 year old whisky is obviously very expensive.I am pleasantly surprised on the nose by fruity notes like pineapple, oranges (peel included) and loads of acacia honey on the one hand, but on the other also mildly peaty notes. Yes, there clearly went some peated malt into the mix. It even has a mildly salty lining, which I quite like. It reminds me a bit of young Ledaig.It is quite oily. Very sweet, to be honest. Again oranges and honey, but also quite a bit of green apples, ginger and liquorice. The peat is even more outspoken than on the nose. Pretty peppery, making it seem less young than its three years.

It might just get a extra point, given the experience from such a young whisky. Neat: A gorgeous bonfire in the woods. Some honey notes, and a nice lair of peat. I can’t help to think of some Ardmores? Some exotic fruits, like mango. It’s amazing how good this is, despite the young age. With water: Even with some water, the profile is about the same. Less Ardmore bourboness, and more peaty, leathery notes now.Neat: There’s a little peat in the foreground, peppermint indeed and a citrus candy note. It’s very fresh, balanced. With water: Less peat, and more pepper mint and candy. But it kind if loses its punch and power with water, even though it’s just a little bit. Neat: Kind of short, but a nice finish.

Water accentuates licorice, citrus and seaweed. Punchy, warming and peat-driven, the taste develops towards red currants, honey and a peppery touch of refill French wine casks.

863,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"Yes, it’s a good one. It’s not only the bottle that’s fancy, more importantly, the liquid inside is also worthy of a thumbs up. While the French oak was on the brink of being too much on the nose, the first sip got rid of all doubts – this is a very well-made, balanced, heavily peated, young Islay malt as it should be. Very pleased to see this will be a permanent product in the Port Charlotte lineup!Full review: https://maltklaus.net/dailydram/2018/06/02/tasting-bruichladdich-port-charlotte-10-yo-2018-release/ "
864,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"Instantly one of the better 10 years olds out there. Proper Islay whisky, but with a Bruichladdich twist. Well-rounded and integrated, this shows a remarkable amount of farmy aromas, which is quite lovely actually. The peat smoke plays its role. Never too dominant, but always unmistakably present. There's a soft layer of sweet, tinned pineapple, as well as candied banana and vanilla custard.Good, oily texture. Mouth-coating. Lots of soot, and plenty of peat and rubber, as well as just a whisper of gun powder. Spices play a role on the palate as well. Mainly cracked black peppercorns.Lingering spices, some gunpowder. Finally some berries as well. Long."
865,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"A very nice 10-year-old expression from Port Charlotte. Some of its parts are classical Islay character of the likes you can find with Ardbeg and Lagavulin, but there is also a very dominant woodiness from the French Oak involved; and I'm not 100% sure that these casks actually compliment the excellent spirit. This whisky is neither a sherry monster nor a classic bourbon driven peat bomb, and thus on some evenings I find it a little bit disconcerting whereas on other occasions it's a perfect session finale. Anyways, it definitely is a BFYB malt and even with those reservations an Islay must-have.Yes, of course it's peaty and smoky, but behind that there is a very, very sweet aroma of zabaglione with lemon sherbet, liquorice and peppermint candy. Some pineapples and cream with star anise and cinnamon are in the background. In spite of being peaty thanks to the bourbon and wine cask mix this smells almost like a dessert whisky. It sure isn't un-nice, but did we expect and want this from a supposedly heavy-hitting PC? Well, the jury's still out...You may add a drop of water, but it doesn't change (or add/improve) much about the general profile of the malt.Imo the palate is better defined than the nose. You may list the PC 10 somewhere between a Bowmore and an Ardbeg, of course the better expressions of them out there. There still is that sweetness from the nose (slightly perfumed too), and of course there also is wood spice (perhaps more than expected from a 10yo), but this evident winy-ness is a little bit more restrained in favour of the character of the distillate. The citrus notes (limoncello) are almost as prominent as the peat, but now there also is that earthy, rooty freshness that wasn't really there on the nose, like gentian and very good absinth. Added to that of course you have those classy Islay flavours like tar, smoked bacon, kelp and sea spray. All in all this is very enjoyable, neat as well as with water.Long, peaty and sweet. It's fine, really, but still on some days the sweetness from the casks tends to be a bit too much for me (acid reflux included...).You should buy this, but please try it first - and try the less wine-driven PC Islay Barley alongside if possible and decide what PC ""style"" you prefer. It's all a matter of taste."
866,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"Quite a bit on the tongue, a certain sharpness is not to be denied. For once, I would find it interesting to be able to put this whisky in the glass with a lower alcohol strength. I could imagine that 46% would not look bad at all (because a few drops of water take the edge off his spine without the whisky becoming flatter).Caramel smoke that immediately settles on the nose. Warm corrugated iron roof, pepper. The smoke note is already special, associations of peat do not really want to occur. Ginger cookies, biscuit dough, malt, a dash of lemon.Strong start with malt, marzipan, almonds, lemon and this very special smoke, which now lets a little peat aroma shine through on the tongue. However, it is not comparable to the peat aroma that the other colleagues on the island produce, the peated whisky. Here too the feeling of warm sheet metal combined with a certain peppery. Applesauce with whole cloves, mashed pears, freshly cut meadow.Medium and dry, caramel candy, honey, toffee, coffee powder."
867,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"It’s a mini Octomore. Same funky wine profiles at less than half the price. Great value, but not a daily dram for most.Rubber, vanilla, white chocolate, wet campfire smoke, damp leaves funk, pencil shavings, dried apricots, buttery Chardonnay. It’s strong and intense, maybe not an everyday dram?Butter, vanilla, spicy ginger, barbecue sauce, very oily and juicy.Quite long but dry, some ginger, mint leaves, and green apple."
868,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"Port Charlotte is one of my favourite islay whiskies and i was quite happy that they released a new 10yo standard bottling.its a quality dram without a doubt but its not to my liking.first of all the nose is rather quiet, the peat is more restrained,the phenolic level rather low. but whats really putting me off, is that dominant winey note.i drank their latest releases octomore 10, laddie 10 v2 and the port charlotte v2. they were also a mix of wine, sherry and bourbon casks and it was a nice variety. but honestly i didnt expect them to go on mixing wine casks into their regualar bottlings.long story short: its a decent drink, with a almost great body and aöpowerful lengthy finish. peat is more prominent in mouth and finish as it is in the nose. also the wine note is not as powerful as it was in the nose. but the peat level seems low. its stats 40ppm but behaves more like 20 or so. its muted by thath rose wine notes i guess.I really wish that they would have stayed at bourbon and sherry or a mix of it in their standard bottlings and leave the rather special taste of wine casks for special and single cask bottlings because it just dont feel right, tastewise. it just dont feel like the farmy originial port charlotte i used to love. and thats no matter of achanging taste over time, its really that cursed wine casks. ;-)if you have no problem with wine cask whisky in general than consider it a fine dram at a reasonable price point (50€/0,7L/50% Alc).If you're more classy and like your common bourbon and sherry influenced islay whisky maybe order a sample first.nevertheless: its good stuff, the bottle didnt last for long, altough i dont see me buying another bottle."
869,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"A pretty potent peat blast, fresh and a bit dirty. Almost perfect for what is (though preferably the finish could have done with a little less dry bitterness).Earthy peat, cowstable, silage, some vanilla, lemon, fresh wood, eastern spices, cumin, (thai) ginger, mint, mild pepper.Creamy and oily mouth feel, dry smoke, savory, farmy, lemony citrus, subtle vanilla, quite spicy (towards chili peppers), quite some ashy bitterness.Long: some sweet vanilla and citrus, charcoal and a really dry ashiness."
870,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"A sample from another bottle, likely a different batch.Is it like I remembered? Can the Laddie's keep consistency?Or more likely, as it's not an unforgettable dram; can I sort my memory and remember what it was like?Still it's solid and pretty good, and I don't think there any need to change neither score nor notes.Thanks to Slàinte Mhath for this sample.Peat, sweet, salty and meaty.Good follow up of the nose. Solid ABV.Long, sweet, spicy and dry."
871,Port Charlotte 10-year-old  Heavily Peated,"This nose is really awesome. With Laphroaig the most beautiful and aromatic smoke from Islay for me.  Mouth and finish then not as strong but absolutely to my taste.This smoke is just great! Sweet and still musty, machine room and still fire in the cowshed. For me, the Islay smokers have the least maritime influence. Absolutely intense. Small minus point for me: nothing to notice of the wine barrels except the sweetness in the first nose. Alcohol note is easy to feel.  A lime and some herbs appear behind the smoke.  With water, the smoke goes back a little and a very slightly fleshy note appears. Grilled meat marinated with herbs.He slams it ... Old oil, citrus but not sour but sweet. Unusual. Here I also find the winey notes. Seasoning from the barrel is also there. Then the oak registers with pepper and a bit of bitterness.  Everything is beautifully embedded in the oily texture.Very pleasantly warming and still occupying. Smoke goes back and herbs, spices and very light bitter notes come. Then goes out with vanilla and some dryness."

889,Bunnahabhain 12-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deMy first impression is dominated by pleasant sherry influences and fresh (salty sea air) as well as floral notes. The alcohol (46.3%) is very well integrated and not noticeable. Sweet honey, nice caramel flavors, oranges, cherries, marzipan, lightly roasted malt, nuts, chocolate, spicy oak and a very soft hint of smoke are slowly rising from my glass. The scent is very full-bodied and strong. The beautiful complexity always surprises me again for a ""only"" 12 years old standard whisky.Strong start with a pleasantly oily texture. A slight tingling puts on the tongue tip (pepper / ginger). Sweet honey and caramel notes are immediately present and form the basis of taste. Toasted malt, walnuts, cocoa / chocolate, spices, ripe apples, oranges and dark sherry fruits (plums & cherries) mingle with the sweet foundation. The spicy oak notes intensify slightly in comparison to the nose and round off the aromatic variety with a maritime touch. Deeply hidden in the background, I register again a soft smoky note. The malt is wonderfully soft, varied and balanced. But beware: dangerously tasty!Medium to long, spicy-sweet and warm. Mild sherry notes, caramel, malt and nutty chocolate gently end the Bunnahabhain. The spicy oak notes are palpable, but never too intrusive or dominant. I perceive neither bitterness nor dryness on the palate."
890,Bunnahabhain 12-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"Such a high quality, well made, 'entry level' malt. I find this just in it's sweet spot, perfectly balanced between cask influence and spirit character. Value (£35) : 9/10.A lovely, complex nose. Sweet notes initially. Butterscotch, vanilla and marzipan. Then the sherry notes come through with notes of dark fruit. An especially generous amount of thick, sweet figs and orange zest. Demarara sugar and sticky toffee pudding. Darker notes of ground roast coffee. Then that coastal sea salt comes through. Some slight ginger spice. Definitely the star of the show here.Good oily mouthfeel. That butterscotch sweetness comes through again along with some honey but not as dominant as on the nose. Here more of the ginger and oak spice comes through,. Plenty of cinnamon and bittersweet mocha. Again more fruit with figs, orange, cherries and dried plums. Then again that salty note appears and carries it into the finish.More salt and spice led now. The tongue prickled from black pepper warmth and some drying oak spice. Quite nutty as well, I picture salted hazelnuts. As the heat resolves, the salt takes over, medium in length."
891,Bunnahabhain 12-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"A very good sherried whisky, especially age and price taken into account. Good fruitiness is balanced with a little punch from ABV and oak. In my opinion, the best ""neat"". The nose gets a little better with water, but it goes at the expense of taste. I'm going to buy a bottle of this!Sherry, consisting of dried fruits such as prunes, but also dark fruits such as plums. Sea spray and spice tones balance it all in a nice way.Relatively thick mouthfeel. Initially, it is the sherry that is dominant, but with hints of sweetness and vanilla from the burbon dishes.

Fruitiness in like oranges and orange peel, dried plumbs and some apricot. Sweetness in like caramel fudge and vanilla. Also a wee nuttiness in like salted and roasted nuts.Again it’s balanced. Flavors are rather harmonious and friendly to the palate. Saltiness, orange, oaky flavors and ginger powder. Some mocha/chocolate flavors are there as well as a hint off coffee.

I was confused by something else ..Lots of dried fruits, orange jam, a crust of bread.

The dirty note is there too.Short to medium, quite salty."

But it's not a “must-have malt” for me.Quite intense and varied beginning on the nose, dried fruits like figs, raisins, plums, all in all rather dark fruity, malty, sweet with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, in addition there are different wood aromas from old musty wood to fresh sawdust, nuts and a little caramel. In the background some grape-rum-nut-chocolatea little more sweetness on the palate, plus the dried fruits which are also accompanied by fresh bananas, cherries and oranges. The sweetness changes every now and then from honey sweetness to a malty sweetness to dark chocolate. All in all, nice and warming in the mouth with an oily, peppery oak flavor without being bitter.Medium-long finish, oak spice remains, little fruit remains, some coffee and chocolate,"
909,Bunnahabhain 18-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"[April, 2019] Bunnahabhain changed its style significantly over the last decades - from a clean, delicate and complex dram to a dirty and simple ""spiked"" modern whisky these days. So I am curious about this 18-years old - is it a traditional or a modern Bunna?It is a dirty one, unfortunately. I am sure many modern whisky drinkers like such a profile but I do not - I prefer a clean and delicate distillate over such cheap thrills (heavy bitter woods, slightly sulphur-spoiled sherry). I will take Bunnahabhain off my list of preferred distilleries very soon, most probably...The colour is deep copper and the nose offers a slightly dirty modern sherry profile with some cheesy and sulphurous off-notes. The sherry itself is not very bold and still leaves enough space for the malt characteristics, too bad the off-notes are stronger than the pleasant ones.The taste is herbal-sherry driven with significant bitter flavours (bitter nuts, green tea, tannins) that turn the dram very dry. The sweet sugars are there, of course, but they never dare to enter the spotlight. After some chewing a dark chocolatey flavour emerges together with some spices. Sorry, this is not my preferred taste (it is too bitter-drying).The initial mouthfeel is hot-peppery and sulphurous-coating with a minor bitter-astringent moment. The finish is long and gets even more drying-astringent with the bitter flavours dominating. Water releases more unpleasant aromas (in my nose, only) of brackish water but it reduces the bitterness in both taste and finish somewhat. I like this dram best a little reduced to about 40% abv."
910,Bunnahabhain 18-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"That comes very close to the perfect whisky. The whisky is perfectly balanced. Age, freshness, Brennereicharakter, barrel influence. Orange, leather, tobacco and old wood. Long finish. Point deduction is only for the price. The whisky is currently a bit overpriced with currently 150 €."
911,Bunnahabhain 18-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"I get why this one is polarizing. The sherry influence is big, bruising, and riddled with sulphur, and there's some serious bitterness in the mix. If you can tolerate these flaws (some would surely prefer to call them ""edges""), you get a wildly entertaining and singular unpeated (but not un-smoky) Islay whisky that could well pass for 20 instead of 18.But yeah: you definitely have to be in the mood for an experience that includes some seriously spicy, dirty, musty sherry butts.Deeply sherried, with a burnt and slightly sulphuric edge: charcoal, smoked barbecue sauce, woodsmoke, gunpowder. The sherry influence strikes me as going more toward PX, with this thick, jammy, raisiny side. However, it doesn't nose too sweet per se, you can still get some salinity and drier, almost mineralic aspects: walnuts, Manzanilla, chalk, linoleum, and some kind of oily brininess. A big and unusual nose, perhaps even somewhat incoherent, but it's certainly entertaining - and seems a bit older than its stated age.Sherry up front here as well, and though it does display the sticky, jammy, slightly cloying mouthfeel of PX maturation, it's way drier than the nose had me assume. Juicy and jammy, with good acidity but also distinct bitterness coming through on the mid-palate. An incongruous combination; I wonder where that would come from. Some tired European-oak butts re-seasoned with sherry? Is that a thing? Well, no matter. After a few sips, the Bunna DNA becomes noticeable behind this onslaught of sherry and bitters, with associations of sea air, sea salt, olive brine, wild liquorice, cracked black pepper, fennel, and just a splash of lime. It's a bit of a clash with the cask-driven notes of morello cherries, bitter almonds, wood coal and dark-roast coffee. A bit incongruous, but again: never boring.Raisins, figs, damsons (in the form of dried fruits as well as fruit jams), a touch of sulphur (gunpowder), and a drying, chalky, salty, Manzanilla-like mouthfeel."
912,Bunnahabhain 18-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"Since I'm a die-hard “Black Art” fan, this bottle was due at some point. It certainly doesn’t come close to the Black Art level, but for an 18 cc it’s really a great bottle. I stashed one right away. But only because it got way below price. A big thank you goes out to Andre from Whisky Evening. Also for the big rehearsal.Full, full and dense, it immediately conveys caramel with just a little vanilla. Thoughts of a nut stollen with raisins come up. A slightly dirty but delicate smoke hovers over everything. I have a light alcohol prick. It comes across as tart, sweet and sour, and if raisins, then they are sulphured. Great and at the same time simple nose.Oily, full, round and very spicy to almost hot on the palate, it starts off. In the foreground, sweet caramel with dark dried fruits. He goes into transition pretty quickly. Hey Hoh, ... it's very tasty and pleasant. In the transition clear dark chocolate at its finest and always an association with medicine (cough syrup?) ... wow, great job!Unfortunately rather short but round, very soft and without flaws. Respect to the master. Then again tender caramel with vanilla at the same time. In addition, continual salty notes and in the background the sulphurized raisins. Friends: This bottle is a fire hazard! Only the PLV now has a problem. So up to 100 € are ok, ... but 140 €? ... unfortunately NO."

925,Bunnahabhain 25-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"Utterly disappointing. The Bunna 25 of old was a sherry bomb with true class and character. This has absolutely none of that. No age, no sherry character, barely anything really. Shame."

929,Bunnahabhain 25-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"Attention in many shops the old bottle is still shown and you get the new bottling, which is no longer made of wood. Does it taste the same as before? I finally emptied a sample. It's good ... But can't get to the old one. In contrast to the 12, which I personally find better than the old one.Salty, maritime and slightly fruity. Wood is inferior to herbsSherry leather woody but also hot pepper catch. Is not a mild whisky for 25 years of original bottling. It's also flavored with strawberry jam. But good part.Pepper and wood remain for a long time."
930,Bunnahabhain 25-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"Here you have to look at the PLV. It should be much cheaper than the old version. Because you have to like him. But it is not worth more than 180 EUR. This is my personal opinion. Sorry Bunnahabhain. But the great wooden box set the bar very high. My tip: wait for the bargain or sample, like me.Immediately there is a wonderful fragrance over the glass. I also expected. The first thought is Hanuta from the leather bag. Soft and round with light fruit notes. Also the lemon, closer to the orange. Maritime seaspray but just a touch. The old wood also answers.It starts off very malty and fruity. Nutty and spicy, it fills the mouth. The oak answers on the tip of its tongue. You have to like that. It has less sherry than the old version. But it is no less tasty. Makes him special. In addition, dry biscuit notes with a maritime aftertaste far from the coast.Strongly drying with a different memory feature than the older B25 in the wooden box. The bitter thing is actually not badly done. Good malt!"
931,Bunnahabhain 25-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"Seems pleasant but not spectacular at first. However, after the first sip it begins take off.Typical old Bunna aromas: sea breeze, leather, polish, salted pink grapefruits, heather, dry sherry, marzipan, essential oils... I don't mind the reduced sherry level; it lets the spirit talk. Perhaps a bit soft, but lovely. Keeps developing and opening up in the glass when left to breathe.Makes you sigh the moment it wets the palate. Silky, creamy, oily, buttery texture, with an enticing sweetness that keeps increasing well into the finish. From the mid-palate onwards, the typical herbal and heathery notes of two-decades-old Bunna begin developing and increasing as well. Spicy in just the right amount. Nice acidity and freshness from the bourbon casks, which suits the maritime profile. Nutty, fudgy notes from the sherried components provide a counterbalance. Goes down dangerously easily.Soft and of medium length, with what appears like quite a few older casks (perhaps those that have fallen below 40%) in the mix. A pinch of white pepper and chunks of salted caramel."
932,Bunnahabhain 25-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"A very nice and well balanced whisky. The flavors are manageable but clear and intense.

Smoke is almost impossible to grasp in the nose. Taste / mouth Start with full fruit body and malt, (hazel) nut, tobacco, very light spiciness, orange / tangerine, herbs. Tingling on the tongue.

937,Bunnahabhain 25-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,
938,Bunnahabhain 25-year-old  Small Batch Distilled,"With the change in design, the composition of the barrel has clearly also changed. The proportion of sherry cask is significantly lower, which of course gives it a different character. As a lover of the XXV wooden box version, I was a bit confused, as I have to admit here. With this version, the price-performance ratio is no longer right at all. This bottle would have to be offered considerably cheaper. But the new direction seems to have found its fans ...Oak seasoning, oranges, honey, heather, mint, vanilla, a little mango and peach, leather.Significantly less full-bodied than the previous bottle. Orange, peach, oak seasoning, cocktail cherries, caraway seeds, tobacco, damp wood, dried apricots and some cardboard.Medium-long finish with vanilla, apricot, oak spice and a slightly older and slightly damp tea towel."
939,Bunnahabhain An Cladach,"An Cladach is rather discombobulating. Whilst it’s delivered in a litre bottle for a relatively reasonable price (56 Euros at Frankfurt airport at present) I’m struggling to understand its overall proposition. As a younger sherried dram, it shares a lot of DNA with the distillery’s core range 12 year old – except, it’s nowhere near as solid an offering. There’s some agreeable flavour combinations here, but like Bunna’s wine cask influenced Eirigh Na Greine (also previously available in travel retail) there’s just too much infancy here, and some quite perceptible sulphur. Whilst transparency levels are slowly improving in some areas of the whisky world, travel retail is not one of those areas. An Cladach makes no exceptions here either, presenting the drinker with little useful information as to exactly what they’re drinking. Recent NAS bottlings from Bunnahabhain (especially last year’s excellent Moine Oloroso) have all floated my boat, but this fishing vessel is lost with all hands for me.https://www.thedramble.com/tastings/bunnahabhain/bunnahabhain-an-cladach/Obvious sherry influence with toffee, raisins and a punnet of red berries – but all a little mildewed and damp rather than bright and juicy. A slightly metallic aroma hints at copper, reflux and youthfulness – this sits alongside nuttiness (hazelnut), chocolate, coffee (of the instant granulated type) and some struck match. The addition of water changes the fruit composition introducing stone fruits, as well as cake sponge and baking spices.An oily and juicy arrival – 50% suits this nicely. Red berries are up front, and include a combination of fresh, dried and hedgerow varieties. Chocolate, toffee, dates and figs provide some sherried depth and are again joined by underlying earthiness. There’s both a slight steeliness as well as some rawness/almost new make quality around the edges. In the mid to back palate, nuts, spice (predominantly pepper) and wood – with only the first two of these being successful – the oak here is quite sour and rather jarring against the sweeter sherry influences. Water improves the balance of sweet vs. sour – but in doing so loses the viscosity on the arrival.Short to medium with dried berries, chocolate and an over enthusiastic amount of sour, astringent wood."
940,Bunnahabhain An Cladach,"I had a sample of it in an order. Thank you André. It's worth a try, but unfortunately not mine. Artificially. Clearly much better with water!Think the first impression makes the distillery. On the nose you can already see the good will to conjure up something out of it. But it didn't work out. Appears sweet with typical fruits and raisins.He starts immediately very young and lively. But in spite of this, he develops the feeling in his mouth that something is there. A hint of chocolate in the direction of grape and nut. He would also like to represent herbs, but only very weakly. Is there more? No ... or? .... mhh That's not enough for me to tell more.Rather short and bitter, sweet and sour. Already gone. We won't see each other again. Do not find out what it is supposed to be about.

Known for mild and undrinked whiskys, there are a few exceptions in the distillery such as the Moine. The word ""Moine"" is from Gaelic and translated means nothing less than peat. A combination of several barrels, former bourbon, red wine and sherrycasks in first and second fill, are used for the Bunnahabhain Moine. This gives the Islay whisky intense smoky notes and a velvety body.

1019,Bushmills Original,"A freebie. I’d never buy it. Buying some of the most hyped and discussed new Irish ‘whiskey’ in the shape of Waterford, bagged me a free 50ml of standard Bushmills. It’s never occurred to me to ever try popular Irish whiskey, at least not to buy in a bottle (bars nonwithstanding). So off we go. On the nose and it’s a glue sniffers paradise. Sweet, woody, sour, an acetone and baked apples. There’s white pepper too. It’s not very nice. It really is a bit naff and there a bitter note too. Dare I?In the mouth, oh WOW! This is a first, an overwhelming sense of Parma Violets sweets. That strange, old grandma, potpourri vibe, a perfumy palate. It’s sweet and the Parma violets thing arrives after the initial, light, woody arrival. It’s then translations into ginger, pepper and mildly astringent wood and all the way in the back count a floral note. Kind of honeysuckle with marigolds. I’m confused. There’s enough here I don’t like, it’s smooth and and as a kid I may have overdone the Parma violets, but there’s something strangely enjoyable about the floral thing I get from it. But not enough to buy a bottle. This mini was quite large enough. I can confidently say, never again."
1020,Bushmills Original,Nose: Sweet honey. Bright citrus fruits and apples. Some light malt. Flowery aroma.Palate: Slightly oily feel. Buttered biscuit. Fruity and sweet. A citrusy tart taste. Somewhat malty.Finish: Medium. Malt lingering. Slight tang and waves of citrus.Overall Score: 70. Never been a fan of Bushmills. It’s not the worst whiskey in the world but it’s never my first choice. It’s got enough flavor to please someone just looking for a simple glass of whiskey but I would never say this is impressive by any means.This bottle was gifted to me in 2013 and I think I opened it for the third time today. This bottle stays at my mother’s house. Nobody in the house drinks it because it’s just kind of...meh.

1035,Cameronbridge Cameron Brig  Pure Single Grain,"Does not amount to anythingCameron Brig is the ‘official’ single grain release of the Lowland grain distillery Cameron Bridge. This bottle is dirt cheap and looks rather plain (which I like), but that says little of the quality inside. Or does it?At first, absolutely nothing happens on the nose! Seriously, it needed a full five minutes of hand warmth before even the slightest aroma appeared. Slowly but surely there is some caramel, overripe oranges, vanilla and wood shavings. It is very light on the palate with a little more fruit than on the nose. Think pineapple and pears… but the candy version. A hint of liquorice from the wood makes the whole a little interesting. Even a bit old school. A slight bitterness appears towards the end, undoubtedly from the wood.Contrary to my expectations, the finish is medium long. I would have expected this to hardly have a finish at all. That’s a pleasant surprise.Well, truth be told this grain does not amount to anything, but with enough patience it is a little bit interesting on the palate. It will not surprise you that most of the production is destined for the blending industry to provide bulk for Haig, J&B, Bell's, Black & White, VAT69 and – obviously - Johnnie Walker.

1043,Crown Vat 20-year-old,"From the pamphlet: “More than two decades ago, with particular care, J. Sykes selected and brought in several famous Single Malt Whiskies, allowing them to mature for nearly 15 years before blending. Only now is this very special blend made available, in celebration of Higsons Bicentenary Year”. J. Sykes and Co were wine and spirit merchants out of Liverpool active between 1906-1986 according to national archives. Business must have been good because J. Sykes and Co bought Higsons Brewery in 1918, which at the time was already almost 140 years old. Business continued to flourish until they were eventually bought out and the Brewery closed in 1989 after nearly 210 years. 1980 was Higsons Bicentenary, which is what this bottle is celebrating and it would be reasonable to assume 1979/1980 is when it was bottled. Based on the little pamphlet attached ‘several famous malt whiskies’ were matured for nearly 15 years before blending (in 1966), which means at least some of these casks were early 50’s distillate. Distilleries which include: Ardbeg, Highland Park, Glen Grant, Tomatin, Glenlivet, North British and Cameronbridge. Little piece of History, this."
1044,Johnnie Walker Blue Label  Ghost & Rare Brora & Rare,"[August, 2020] This is a must try - simply to find out how many drops of old Brora they added to this batch......and my best guess is they used a teaspoon to add Brora to this vat. The nose is pretty nice (but nothing really special) while both the taste and finish are underwhelming. The casks they used were pretty much over the top with way too many bitter tannic notes and way too low enjoyable flavours. This is nothing else than a marketing gimmick addressed to people who have heard of but never tasted a Brora single malt release, and it is of a rather poor quality (given its price point).The colour is deep gold but this is irrelevant because Diageo usually adds caramel to all of its blends (and most single malts, too). The nose is delicate and complex as can be expected from such a vat - but I swear I did not find any specific Brora aroma, Diageo! The Clynelish, Glenlossie and Glenkinchie are quite present as are the grains but there is not a single whiff of peat smoke or of these irresistable machine oils running out of rusted ship engines which you often find in old Brora. Anyway, this nose is pretty fine and the blender did a good job, no doubt. Is it something special? No, not really - certainly not if you expected anything Brora-esque...The taste is much weaker and dominated by a rather bitter wood-driven Glenlossie profile with some Glenkinchie impressions. I do neither find any Brora nor Pittyvaich nor Clynelish trademark flavours in this mix and even the grainy notes are rather shy. The wood grows stronger on the palate which turns the taste towards bitterness and completely drives it out of any balance (was there a balance before, not sure). Water strengthens the bitter-tannic aromas in the nose and turns the taste even flatter, so forget about it. By the way, forget about the taste at all unless you like bitter aspirin-alike drinks.The initial mouthfeel is disappointing with a flat and slightly bitter-astringent texture which did not coat anything. Hey, you can do better than that, Diageo! Respectively, the finish is short as a lightning and adds nothing remarkable except growing bitter-drying impressions which become annoying towards the end. What a shame given the price point of this dram (luckily I had a sample only)!"
1045,Johnnie Walker Blue Label  Ghost & Rare Brora & Rare,"This is a wonderfully good Blue Label, in which the end result is much more than the sum of its parts. A masterpiece. Oh, by the way… the second edition will be coming soon. And the protagonist in that one will be that other trophy malt from Diageo. Yup, you’ve guessed it: Port Ellen. Start saving up.It does not happen often (at least not often enough) that I get an ‘OMG’-moment when first sniffing a whisky. This is one of those. A very rich, aromatic, complex nose on roasted pineapple, peach, oranges, joined quickly by earthy notes as if I am standing on the earthen floor of an old dunnage warehouse. And while it is impossible to guess how much Brora went in the mix, I could swear I can detect it! The typical waxiness from Clynelish is also very prominent. Loads of nuts (almonds and hazelnuts) and some honey give it an extra sweet twist. It is even slightly tropical in the background with some banana and coconut. Hint of eucalyptus. In case you were still wondering: yes, this is very complex!The arrival is very sweet, a tad spicy and quite smoky. Yellow and green fruit softly evolve towards barley sugar and nuts, upholstered with mint, pipe tobacco, garden herbs, dark chocolate, candy floss and crème brûlée. The smokiness grows.The finish starts smoky, but then quickly makes room for subtle sweet, fruity notes and some oak at the death."

1047,Johnnie Walker Blue Label  Ghost & Rare Brora & Rare,"The nose is lovely but the palate does not even get close to the nose, it does not matter what the sum of parts are if there is a flaw and this is too woody and bitter at this price, shame.I think there is a fair bit of Glenkinchie in this, pretty sure it is higher proportion than the others, the ginger spicy aspect of the profile gives it away.The first thing to say is that this is a nice nose, plenty going on, stewed forest fruits, various woods, a little peat, honeycomb, hints of vanilla, roasted coffee. ginger biscuits.Now that is spicy, very lively indeed with the peat mixing with the sherry and spice really well, but there is a definite bitter woodiness which for me really spoils this but lets see if it settles down with a little air.The second mouthful is sweeter but even more spicy with a real ginger kick, it is a little drying, a little woody but not as much as before but still a woody after taste.Parts of the profile are really good but the woody bitterness ruins this for mequite long, spicy and bitter"

1054,Caol Ila 12-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"Many moons ago, it was a dram of Caol Ila 12 that ignited my passion for whisky, and what a journey it has been. Time to revisit my old friend! On the nose, puffs of twiggy bonfire smoke give way to green apples, lemon and briny hints of seawater. Heather honey, black olives and peppery oak spices drive the full-bodied and oily taste, always accompanied by well-integrated sooty salinity. Citrus fruits, subtle vanilla and complex tea notes linger in the long and peaty finish. I'm biased, I know, but this characterful Islay malt is still overlooked and underrated!RATING: 4.0/5.0 stars ≙ 87 pts → FIRST-CLASS"
1055,Caol Ila 12-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"This is the review of the very first release of the standard 12-years old Caol Ila from 2002 (hence distilled in 1990).[August, 2019] After an interesting old versus new head-to-head of the standard 18-years old Caol Ila edition that resulted in significant differences (3 points) I decided to do the same with the 12-years old standard edition. It is a head-to-head of the 2018 release (NEW, WB id 120834) versus this first ever bottling from 2002 (OLD, there is neither a Classic Malts logo nor a www.malts.com reference on the back label)......and the differences between these two are again significant. OLD is a typical old Traditional Scotch dram (distillate-driven, more complex, balanced all the time) while NEW shows elements of the modern whisky style already (much more wood-driven which leads to an imbalace during the finish, less complex). Guess what I prefer (by two points)?The colour of OLD is two shades darker at old gold than NEW which is at jonquiripe corn (despite they used caramel on NEW). The nose of OLD offers a balanced sweet-peaty pofile with honeys, ripe yellow fruits, barley sugars and maritime-peaty aromas. The smoke grows stronger upon breathing without harming the balance as additional waxy and autumn floral notes join in as well. A pretty fine nose for a 12-years old, indeed1 NEW offers a quite different profile with shy unripe green fruits, more sugars and a different smokey impression (no maritime notes, rather like a cold bonfire). It is balanced too with more wood impact, but much simplier than OLD. I clearly prefer the nose from 2002.The taste of OLD is quite bold on delicious sweet flavours over fine peat smoke notes. The fruits are present all the time as are the barley sugars, later some waxes and meaty notes (smoked bacon) join in. It is not very complex but it is a tasty mix, easy to quaff. NEW's taste is much more wood-driven with sweet barley sugars balancing the bitter tannins nicely. It is easy drinkble too but a complete different style. Again I prefer OLD clearly.OLD arrives warming and instantly coating on the palate without distracting moments. The initial mouthfeel of NEW is warming and coating too but a little less impressive with a minor bitter-astringent moment (tannins at work). Both drams own a long finish where OLD adds some spices and herbal impressions without distracting moments at all. NEW turns more bitter during the finish with a drying mouthfeel, now the tannins of the wood take control and drive NEW out of balance, unfortunately. Water is not needed on both."

1057,Caol Ila 12-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"A seriously complex dram, incredible value for money.Savoury, peaty, solventy, sweet. A lot going on here, you'll keep coming back to this and finding new nuances.Savoury notes of smoked fish, savoury oatcakes, sharp spices of pepper, fresh ginger and mustard. Hint of leather.Lots of complex green and earhty notes: damp forest floor, moss, bark, mentholic rosemary, hint of thyme. Bitter green tomato stem.There is a solventy spirit sweetness to this (think Johnnie Walker (wonder why!), tequila. This is made pleasant by *hints* of honey / vanilla and many over-ripe fruity notes: banana, black plum, morello cherry. Hints of lemon and grapefruit give freshness.The marine notes are my favourite part though. I guess you could call it 'sea-breeze', but there's also a much sharper notes of seaweed, ambrinol (sharp ambergris aromachemical). I've been working on a woody-marine perfume recently, and many of the smells overlap.Salty, mentholic, spicy, fruity. A bit bitter. Pleasant acidity throughout the palate.Black pepper crackers. Cool rosemary, cardamom and menthol, warm ginger. Again strong notes of seaweed and ambrinol. Some fruits: lemon, grapefruit, green apple, banana.Finishes smoky-woody, slightly tannic and drying, sweetened by honey. At times I perceive the wood as ashy, bringing to mind cigars. Other times it's just smoke and dry wood."
1058,Caol Ila 12-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"I always like it better!  An outstanding standard, PLV almost unbeatable!  Gentle, soft smoke, not medically.  Rather chimney smoke.  Islay-typical salty, sea breeze, sea spray ...?  Citrus but not as strong as Bowmore.  Who does not know him yet, definitely try!  Also for advanced very recommendable!  86/100"
1059,Caol Ila 12-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"For me, one of the most underrated single malts out there, a very nice standard islay for people who are not just blind ash-horny. ;)Stronger peat level than expected, but at the same time typically Caol Ila moderately oily soft, the peat is quite sweet, which is one of the roundest Islay experiences, but still unmistakably Islay. Beautiful honey sweetness, finest lemon sweet notes, a beautiful glow like a still burning out campfire, but without ashes, brown sugar, some thyme, of course, light salt, a little bit of white grapes, probably. but that is a deception of the DE in the back of my mind that I like so much, light apricot in betweenBeautiful gentle salt spray on the coast, a smoldering fire, but here also no real smoke or dry ashes as other Islays, more a general ""glow"" of the coal, sweet forest honey with herbs in it, all typical CI here also beautiful oily-viscous, the apricot is also to be found in between, with core, sweet-bitter with the beautiful salt tickThe forest honey with a bit of ash remains nice, brown sugar and young oak chips, dry herbs, medium"

1063,Caol Ila 12-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,
1064,Caol Ila 18-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"This is the review of the very first release of the standard 18-years old Caol Ila from 2002 (hence distilled in 1984).[August, 2019] Tonight is the night to do a long-planned old versus new head-to-head of the standard Caol Ila edition, 2015 release (NEW, WB id 96997) versus this first ever bottling from 2002 (OLD, there is neither a Classic Malts logo nor a www.malts.com reference on the back label)......and the differences between the two are really significant. Of course, both present the lovely Caol Ila DNA but OLD indeed offers a complex and bold old-stylish profile while NEW rather goes for the modern wood-driven whisky ""zeitgeist"" that is much more simple and (to me) rather boring. Do not get me wrong, still the new 18-years old Caol Ila is a nice dram to drink but its profile lacks a lot of personality compared to its 2002 sibling.[June, 2021] I re-tasted this dram tonight and fully confirm my old review and score. What a difference to the newer batches, and by the way: Angus from whiskyfun scored a sample from this very bottle 90 points too.The colour of OLD is one shade darker at old gold while NEW is at yellow gold (despite they use caramel to adjust it). The nose of the two drams is very different: Old offers a truly old-stylish profile with lots of nice OBFs , fruits, honeys, waxes, oils, herbs and significant maritime peaty aromas. This is the adorable sweet-peaty profile from the best years of Caol Ila (simply check the ratings of older vintage 1984 bottlings - 2002-18=1984). Contrary to OLD the NEW release shows much more bitter-herbal wooden notes but misses both the fruity-sweet and maritime flavours almost completely. What a difference!The taste of OLD is layered and greatly chewable so it offers all its delicious flavours like in a parade. The sweet fruits and barley sugars, the maritime peaty notes , the spicy wooden flavours and many more impressions are in a perfect balance without any flaw. Great stuff to quaff! NEW's taste is not layered, unfortunately and dominated by bitter-peaty flavours with the sweet notes playing a minor role only. It gets rather drying-astringent over time - but again: still NEW is a fine dram that I like to drink. Nonetheless it is a three points difference to OLD.The initial mouthfeel of NEW is warming and just a little coating without distracting moments while OLD arrives absolutely charming and instantly coats the whole of the mouth. Of course it shows no distracting moments either. OLD's finish is long and vanishes in several fading waves without any distracting moments again. All stays harmonic and balanced and the old-style waxes and earthy notes form a grand finale. The finish of NEW is shorter but still medium to long and stays on the bitter-astringent side (with additional eucalyptus notes, just like the end of the taste was). Again, this is enjoyable but a huge difference to the 2002 edition. Water is not recommended on NEW as it just flattens the dram. OLD is a better swimmer but still I like it best when neat."
1065,Caol Ila 18-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"With a natural preference for the independent bottlers, one tends to overlook how good some of the official bottlings can actually be. More settled and complex, the years have tamed this Caol Ila 18 quite a bit. Leaning towards smoldering bonfires, sea spray and sour apples, the nose unfolds with buttermilk, lemon and hints of aniseed. A wonderful combination of peaty, salty-sweet and acidic flavors dance on the palate, raw and yet elegant. Herbal tea, dry peat smoke and a touch of miso soup characterize the long finish. This malt is worth every penny!RATING: 4.2/5.0 stars ≙ 89 pts → FIRST-CLASS [+]"
1066,Caol Ila 18-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"Usually, I only use a simple Glencairn glass for a tasting, to ensure a stringent evaluation of different whiskys for me. For the Caol Ila 18, I used the 1920s Professional Blenders glass for once, as I had the impression that the Glencairn does not quite live up to this whisky. And it turns out that the 1920s can tease out even more flavors from the whisky. Actually, I do not use this glass anymore, because I had a lot of whisky too concentrated and alcoholic in the nose.  In any case, the Caol Ila 18 is a gentleman who is at peace and gives you the feeling that he does not have to prove anything to you. Either, you get involved in it, or you just pass by - which would be a pity, because you would miss a very pleasant representative of Islay's north coast.Since one thinks first of all, to have an unpeated Caol Ila in the glass, so reserved, so subtle is the smoke - and it does not even show up from the beginning, but she has to literally work forward, past the Overripe bananas, gooseberries and pineapple slices. Sweet and fruity, it presents itself in the nose, with a pinch of salt and sea scent. Dried orange slices, honey, milk chocolate. Everything is very gentle, very smooth and dignified.Mild approach, in which from the beginning - which contrast to the nose - a dry smoky touch on the tongue lays. Creamy and dry in equal parts, with coffee beans, crème brulée, toffee, malt. With its 43% it glides pleasantly over the tongue. Nut brittle and chopped almonds, marzipan bread. The wood content is pleasantly balanced.Medium to long finish, dry. The dry oak planks are intensified in the finish, salt and smoke attract again clearly, plus a pinch of pepper and mild spices."
1067,Caol Ila 18-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2019/08/14/bottle-polishing-an-islay-trio/Early this year I wrote [with regards to an 11yo Caol Ila WB] ‘I’m reminded how much I love Caol Ila almost everytime I have it‘. It’s weird then that I rarely buy it,… maybe because it’s always there? I bought this because the price was insanely good. Let’s see where the official 18yo is at in 2018/19.N: Dry yet moorish cereal-sweet barley with subtle onion-y > > pickled onion-y, peaty & husky desiccated coconut-y aromas.T: Dry-not-dry husky creamy smoky < barley with oily/buttery coconut topped off with a herbal/candle wax, vanilla essence-d icing and a curious combo of boot polish and pub style pickled whelks, a splash of cider and an even smaller splash of lager-lime top. How very 19,… you choose the decade.F: Light-smokey barley, dirty lemon-y oily garage floors, some coppery > iron fillings,… concluding with husky peaty dry barley with light black tea, remnants of nicotine and just a hint of menthol-y Jif/Cif-like dry lemon. Finishes true on sweet malted barley.C: Over time it showed itself as a dependable deliver-er and yet totally unmoving as if the life had left it before it had even reached the bottling plant. It did however really improve after being poured into an empty glass with the remnants of an Old Elgin 8yo [WLP]. It was the caramel banana > molasses that gave it some body/balls. Maybe this and Deanston 12 would work for a Douglas Laing Double Barrel?"
1068,Caol Ila 18-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"Caol ila 18.  I want to charm friends. To impress them. I need an elegant, fragrant scotch, neither too strong nor too diluted. Sobriety but respondent ... to discover the magnificence of peat scotches of Islay without disgusting them too much.  Anyway, are you available tonight?"
1069,Caol Ila 18-year-old  Islay Single Malt Whisky,"Caol Ila 18yo (Batch L7255)  Nose:  You notice first of all that the smoke here is much more restrained. A campfire on the beach, with moist wood and seaweed, whose scent is carried from a distance to the nose. Where he has lost smoke, he has gained fruit. The green apple is joined by red, while the citrus is juicy peach. Licorice, some freshly grated nutmeg, the wood is noticeable. Fine herbal scents: thyme, a little coriander.  A complex nose that invites you to take a long time to sniff, the smoke does not show any medical notes here.  Mouth:  In the mouth, it is initially slightly astringent. The 18-year-old is also much more fruity and the smoke is finely integrated in the form of a light ashiness. Apples, peaches, a little pear compote, almond slivers, rum grapes, a few drops of brine, olives, herbs and oak spice.  Finish:  Long, only slightly ashen, for the first time the oak dominates. Light grape sweetness.  Conclusion:  Very well balanced, a malt without blemish and blame. The cultivated smoke is good for him, the fruitiness and the oak spice in the finish as well. Only that the price jump from 12 to 18 is quite high, is a bit steep."

Let's look for similarities and differences. Nose: The Distillers Edition is nice and sweet on the nose, candied fruits (orange, pineapple), some elderberry, rose water. But the maritime Caol ila character is not neglected either. Seaweed, crab chips and fine citrus notes, plus a smoke that I would name here with a smoldering coal fire. In any case, the sweet side that comes into the bottling through the Moscatel barrels is dominant. The Distillers Edition is significantly sweeter than the standard 12, while the Feis bottling comes closer to this, especially with water, but adds an additional odor dimension. Mouth: The Distillers Edition is sweet, soft and fruity to begin with. Fruits glazed with honey. Vanilla. Rauch rather in the second row, especially in a direct comparison. Finish: Distillers Edition and Diluted Feis Bottling are both sweet on the finish, the Feis has a strong oak finish. Undiluted, the Feis has too strong oak in the finish. Conclusion: I find it exciting how sweet the Distillers Edition comes off in this comparison. I don't remember previous batches so sweetly, maybe it's just the day's shape 86/100"
1083,Caol Ila 2008  The Distillers Edition,
1084,Caol Ila 25-year-old,"[May, 2017]  I had this dram during the First Annual Caol Ila Feis Ile Dinner (yes, this was the official name of it!) at the Ballygrant's Inn.  And I did it head-to-head versus the 30-years old (WB id 58218).Colour:  Both have the same colour of old gold (yes, Diageo uses caramel to fix it that way).  The texture of the 25y shows some fast fat legs and late sticky tears.  The 30y shows early but very small tears and some late slow legs and fat tears.Nose:  The 25y offers this adorable sweet and strong phenolic profile with maritime aromas and some nice OBFs that I adore, one to sniff for hours.  The nose of the 30y is more subtle but on the same profile.  Hard to say which one is better - the 30y is more complex and delicate while the 25y is more powerful and impressive. Finally I opt for the 30y.Mouthfeel:  The 30y instantly coats the whole of the mouth with a slightly peppery feeling but without any distracting (bitter or drying) moments.  That is really good!  Surprisingly the 25y is smoother than the 30y on the mouthfeel but at least as much coating.Taste:  A very mellow and complex sweet-peaty-phenolic-maritime profile on the 25y that is multi-layered, really excellent.  The 30y counters this with more punchiness (surprisingly) and a greater complexity of flavours adding more spicy and malty aromas to it than the 25y.  But again I like the 25y a little better (on a very high level).Finish:  Both are very long with the 30y vanishing in several waves without any distracting notes.  Close to perfection it is (remember Yota)!  The 25y finishes a little shorter (just long, not very long...), but again without any flaws or off-notes.  This round wins the 30y year old.Water is not needed on both (it does not really harm and smoothen the drams even further, but it takes away some power, too).  I am really blown away by the high quality of both drams, the only flaw is the drinker-unfriendly price tag choosen by Diageo for the 30 year old.  I am willing to pay as much as 250 Euro for the 30 year old - but not a single Cent more!"
1085,Caol Ila 25-year-old,"Start with a very relaxed nose. And when you think, 'was that now?' he opens up wonderfully and delivers beautiful ""elderly"" flavors. And that both in the nose, as well as on the tongue. I like it very much. Until recently you could find it for less than 100 €. Now he's getting dressed, but still worth his money.In the distance a little bit of soft smoke, hardly noticeable. And like a breeze over again. A lightly spicy bacon note comes, raisins and figs work forward. At first rather discreet and restrained, the sweetness of the dried fruit unfolds its full force after a short time. Now come also leather and tobacco notes, to fine-sour chocolate and vanilla. Nice development in the nose.This is where the peat smoke on the tongue makes itself felt right at the beginning. However, he is withdrawn just as quickly as when Verriechen. Also on the tongue comes after a while a nice bacon note, in addition to old leather and: beautiful old oak planks. Vanilla and milk chocolate are coming. Over time, the ""elderly"" taste on the tongue tart, peppery, almost furry - and then gets the curve to a pleasantly fluffy creaminess.Medium to long, pleasantly dry, plum sweet and with returned fine smoke."
1086,Caol Ila 25-year-old,"[September, 2017]  What is better:  A batch that contains the flavours of many different casks or a carefully selected single cask release?  To check this I selected two 25-years old Caol Ila from the great 1984 vintage for a head-to-head namely this original bottling (OB) bottled May, 19th, 2010 and a Bladnoch Forum release (BF, WB id17481) with 52% abv.Colour:  The OB is at old gold (but remember Diageo uses caramel to fix the colour) while the BF is at jonquiripe corn.  The texture of the BF shows medium fast legs and many small sticky tears.  The OB shows much slower legs and late fat sticky tears so its oiliness is better.  Nose:  The OB offers a real great nose on lots of different aromas with adorable peaty, fruity, malty and spicy wooden notes and some OBFs.  It is very complex and beautiful balanced, one to sniff for hours.  The BF is more closed due to the abv but owns a peaty, malty and wooden profile too, just the fruits are shy in the background.  I like the OB more here.Initial mouthfeel:  The OB instantly coats all of the mouth with a warming feeling, no distracting moments (just as the texture promised).  The BF is coating too (but less than the OB) and it has a slight drying feeling (metallic).  Again I like the OB better.Taste:  The BF shows a peaty-barley sugary-herbal flavours profile that is somewhat layered and easy to sip.  The OB is truly multi-layered and multi-flavoured on the palate, very delicious.  I do not name all the different flavours but it adds nice chocolatey and honey-sweet notes to the peat and fruits.  This is simply ""lecker"".  I prefer the OB by several points.Finish:  Both own a long finish that nicely vanishes in waves.  The OB is really sticky here and I still taste it even after minutes with all of its beauty.  No bitter or drying notes at all.  The BF adds more sugars to the finish and has no distracting moment either.  Nevertheless I prefer the OB again.Water opens the BF up and the nose gets more complex as does the taste - now it comes closer to the OB and guess what, I like it best when reduced to about the same strength as the OB.  Water is not needed on the OB (it just gets flatter).So this head-to-head showed a clear result:  A batch of many (good) casks provide a greater aromas and flavours variety and a more balanced profile than just a single cask (of course, it all depends on which single cask was choosen).  As all bottlings of the 1984 vintage of Caol Ila (that I tasted so far) were great the 2010 Diageo 25-year old should be and indeed is a stunner.  I tasted all later 25-year Diageo Caol Ila releases and they are good too, but this one is the best so far."
1087,Caol Ila 25-year-old,"A great thank you to Slàinte Mhath and Feorag86 for this generous 700ml ""sample"" :-)A good representative of the more matured and more rounded and refined side of Islay.First thing to hit the nose is a light sweet fruityness.Quite a bit of citrus, but a very sweet kind, almost sugary orange.Also apple peel and melon.There's smoke, very lightly peated. Nowhere near the Islay peat in younger peated Caol Ila.Even so, leave the glass for a while and there are notes of slightly sour maritime peat and smokey bacon sitting on top of the glass.Deeper down some fine leather notes, and some very nice roasted barley.A really great nose, delicate and nicely ballanced.Texture is not quite up to oily, but it's mouth covering and sticky.Smoke and peat more prominent on arrival, then it kind of retracts.Some fruity sweetness that I can't define, as it is rapidly over powered by dried meat, leather and slightly salty chocolate.The smoke returns in the finish.With it a groving sweetness.A pinch of salt.Quite long and pleasant."

1089,Caol Ila 25-year-old,"If you could buy a 25-year-old Ardbeg or Lagavulin for way under 200 €, most peatheads would go nuts. Not so with Caol Ila, which has always puzzled me. Delicate, complex and surprisingly fruity, the aroma ranges from peach, lemon oil and mild spices to pinewood, soot and hints of sage. Flavorwise, the peat smoke has taken a back seat, while aromatic, citric and slightly resinous notes mingle with eucalyptus, honey and white pepper. Espresso, salmiak and even a touch of gin fade in the gentle finish. Showcasing the quiet side of Islay, this is a superb malt.RATING: 4.4/5.0 stars ≙ 90 pts → SUPERB [-]"
1090,Caol Ila 25-year-old,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2019/04/22/feis-ile-2018-caol-ila-part-1/N: Superbly balanced, ideally aged Caol Ila through and through.

1091,Caol Ila 25-year-old,"I had times somewhere for just under 100 EUR. From this top PLV, it was not far to try this malt. Now I'm glad to have 2 more of it. House whisky.The nose is a dream. A campfire by the sea with sweet fruits and leathery soft smoke. Bright apples as well as spicy dark herbs peat. Christmas ingredients like nuts, clementines in a dusty, musty leather bag. Is there some thyme in the background? Very very fine.The palate does not hold what the nose promises. But wonderfully oily and creamy, he goes to the mouth. Now more towards wood campfire and tender coffee notes. Salty troche fruits in the middle part and the sour apple in addition. Alright, but not as good as expected. Nevertheless top level.Medium to short but soft, this dried fruit with off-drying oak and spicy wood notes. Some citrus notes with sweet peat and again the sea breeze. Very pleasantly mild and soft, he seduces constantly to refill. Class malt."

It’s all perfectly soft for my nose.T: A decidedly firm savoury/mulch-y/malty start, the mouthfeel dry-oily and moving chocolate-y and the smokiness deep and subtly penetrating. More toasted vanilla again, a touch squidgy-malty-spongy and medicinal hints equal to more liquorice wood.F: Once the smoked vanilla sponge settles, it’s decidedly dry, ashy and vegetal-sweet – the spirit smoky-clean.C: Showing no lack of commitment at 43%, 25 years+ has delivered a wonderfully mature, super-chilled Islay malt that goes for a very respectable €140 [Sept ’17].

This is just younger, that's its only differentiating characteristic.Yeah, but no. I mean, if you're into young, not-even-into-their-teens-yet peaters, you might dig this nose, but when there's older and better stuff (or quality NAS like the Laphroaig Quarter Cask) out there for the same price, why would you buy this?Yup, a tasty, lush-and-sweet (and young) CI.

1107,Ichiro's Double Distilleries  Ichiro's Malt,"Chichibu & HanyuThe world has gone completely mad about the Chichibu releases, that sell for big bucks… if you first won a ballot to be allowed to buy a bottle, that is. It does not get any crazier than this. This is an older release – albeit still available – from Ichiro-san; his Double Distilleries. The name refers to the fact that this contains young malt from his new Chichibu distillery, vatted with the legendary Hanyu malt from his grandfather’s distillery that closed in 2004.The nose is surprisingly simply. Sweet barley sugars, young apples, yuzu, hazelnuts and caramel. Hint of apricot and flowery honey. Slowly evolves towards toffee apples and macadamia nuts. A fresh note of mint. I would have guessed a Lowlander if tasted blind. The body is light. Again fresh and bright on honey, apples and some apricots, but I do get a little prickle now from white pepper, ginger and cinnamon. Very sweet indeed. But nothing earth shattering.The finish is rather short, sweet on honey with a bit of vanilla and pepper.The angel on my right shoulder says ‘Japanese whisky with Hanyu, must be great, right?’, while the devil on my left shoulder whispers ‘A lot of young Chichibu with just a drop of Hanyu’. Anyway, 130 EUR is a lot of money. Thanks, Marcel."

Missing a bit of potato in the mouth.Nose strong enough and chiselled  Peach, oak, vanilla, fresh sugarcane.  A little green and young.In the mouth chemical candy, sweet fruits. Papaya, pear, peach.  Vanilla, licorice.Long finish on the fruits of the mouth."

Creamy, but not very sweet, indeed there is a hint of bitter almonds, but still very pleasant and very elegant. With water it becomes more anonymous, loses consistency and even flavor.Quite long, creamy finish, a hint of cocoina just before fading.

1116,Ichiro's Double Distilleries  Ichiro's Malt,"The honey sweetness is very comforting and accessible, it’s a great gateway into whiskies, it certainly isn’t harsh by any standards, and the floral and fruity notes are bright and almost cheerful. These are all notes that would almost seem to fit in with a hotel breakfast, brunch of just an afternoon set of tea and cakes.The oakiness is maybe the harshest of the notes in this bottle, with a slight twang of bitterness that surfaces as the whisky recedes. But it is one that adds some contrast to the sweetness, which would otherwise become somewhat one dimensional.This whisky is great for those starting out in their whisky journey, I think those who like pastries, chocolate croissants, freshly cut flowers, and tea and scones would vibe with this.Link to review: https://88bamboo.co/blogs/the-bamboo-post/ichiros-malt-double-distilleriesColour is maple syrup gold if my eyes don’t deceive me. On the nose. Very sweet! A floral, vanillic sweetness that is a mix of lavender, honey, honeysuckle and ixoras. There’s a maltiness to it as well, much like lavender early grey cookies. The aromas are very strong, almost like what you would expect with bourbon except without the spicy edges. This takes several whiffs to fully appreciate, so I’d recommend nosing it several times, letting it air for a little and swirl before nosing again. On second nosing, I get fruitier notes, though these are alittle deeper and more in the backdrop, apples, peaches, nectarines, still very sweet. And then some woody oak which blends into the distinctive sandalwood that Japanese Oak is famous for, that agarwood incense that you find at temples.Onto the palate. Fairly light bodied which is surprising given the nose, which would have led me to think it might have been syrupy. A nice surprise indeed! It’s definitely spicy and tingly upfront so you might have to make a conscious effort to let it cool down on the palate before finishing it.Similar to the nose, you can taste the corresponding honey sweetness and bright fruity notes, freshly cut apples, apricots, peaches. Very crisp and succulent. Somehow this takes me to that scene of The Sound of Music in the midst of the valleys. This feels very clean and bright like a day on Swiss Alps.There’s also a very gentle maltiness that is just noticeable. Butter biscuits. Would almost seem like this whisky would somehow go well with some Ceylon black tea. This maltiness should come from Chichibu I would imagine, since the Hanyu in it is likely much older. This is combined with the oakiness you also get on the nose. It also reminds me of Tim Tams or maybe Arnott’s cookies, the one with chocolate on just the top y’know?The finish. Interesting, there is that same honeyed sweetness that follows through (come to think of it, it reminds me of Honey Stars, the cereal), but there is a slight bitter note. Almost like an extension of the oakiness from the palate. It’s fairly faint, but I would think this is the result of the Mizunara used on the Chichibu component, which is something only age can mellow out. Given that the Chichibu component is fairly young, this is somewhat a reminder of the Chichibu’s presence.There are some baking spices as well, light dusting of nutmeg, icing sugar, cinnamon, but very light. The finish does go on for awhile."

There is also the smell of a still slightly green banana, as well as vanilla, gooseberry and generally floral notes.First you have malty notes with a clear pepper sharpness. But it is worth keeping the whiskey in your mouth. It develops more and more into exotic fruits, such as B. papaya or mango.

Medium-long finish, woody as usual, not dry and bitter. Very bourbonesque, but rather well-dosed wood, based on the donor and the rather old WID, it will probably be a Japanese. Too old for a Nikka from the Barrel, looking relatively old due to the skilful use of wood, and felt too young for a Yamazaki 12 (that's where my ""Japanese knowledge"": rolleyes: ends).

I really liked the slightly waxy appearance in the nose.First impression: very yellow fruity and pleasantly roasted with toast. There is also something waxy. Or even the Play-Doh clay that I got myself the other day. In places very sweet as powder. Quite a bit spicy too, cardamom comes to mind. In addition, a touch of invigorating acidity in the direction of star fruit. A very flattering, harmonious nose!First, a little bit bitter, cooling alcohol. Marzipan and light fruit. Then it gets melty with toffee and caramel and lots of vanilla. Little oak. In the back it goes towards freshly ground coffee.The alcohol looks a bit fake and diminishes the nice, milk chocolatey, slightly melty feeling on the palate.

But the delicate and soft wood scent has that say herespicy, here again a lot of oak and wood notes which do not feel intrusive but rather well integrated. very soft and round.

However that perfectionism is exactly what makes it lack that enthusiastic spark.Same with the taste, it doesn't make me enthusiastic.Very drinkable, nothing wrong and that's what's wrong.Some would say ""smooth"", I call it slick.

Not an aroma-bomb but it's nice. Taste is Christmas spice, nutmeg, suggestions of eggnog and warming spicy oak, certainly some spicy complexity here. None of the fruit from the aroma shows up in the taste. Instead the taste is all dry spice and salt with a slightly creamy background. A very solid whisky indeed but quite expensive for what you get.

Scotch mist gives an indication that it is non-chill filtered. Creamy honey, candle wax and lemon juice are prominent on the nose, while rich floral notes with a hint of peppermint lurk in the background. The arrival is warming and aromatic, unfolding a distinctly dry and oily character. Oak bitterness with a touch of salt dominates the medium-length finish.

Add a sprinkle of meaty [gammon] soot to that.T: Firm/controlled-sharp peppery-citrus attack. Very soon the mouthfeel gets to work, enveloping the palate and focusing in on waxy, chilli lemon. More saline with water, towards a fluffy-dry-soft barley direction. Water subdues the chilli no end, allowing the fine distillate with an even finer mouthfeel coating to get to work.F: Sustained mouthfeel oozing. Waxy to oily buttery before eventually concluding with the kind of finish you’d expect from a G&T.

The mouth is very soft and harmonious, but the medium body has a rich taste experience. Personally, I don't seem to notice the ""wax"" that the public says. Maybe it is a sensation of wine sticking in the mouth? The end rhyme is long, and you can enjoy it again with another breath and a sip of water.

1189,Connemara Original  Peated Single Malt,"Irish whiskey and peat - do these two go together? Connemara's peatiness has its own style, which is distinctly different from Islay's peat bombs: it is more herbal, restrained and well-integrated. Light and floral on the nose, there is a mix of heather honey, citrus and whiffs of smoke. On the palate, the clean and peppery arrival is followed by an aromatic kick of lemon zest, bitter tea and hints of salt. The peat smoke returns in the finish, lingering on the tongue. Although slightly uneventful and simple, this malt offers a nice variation from the 'Irish theme'.RATING: 3.0/5.0 stars ≙ 80 pts → AVERAGE"

1191,Connemara Original  Peated Single Malt,"I already have the second of this Whísky on the shelf, I don't know exactly why. He's so far from the standard. Maybe that's exactly why.Very aromatic smoke. Slight herbal note. In the background some vanilla, maybe honey? Is there also oak? The (green) apple remains in the foreground. Actually a great nose ..... or not!? ... but just fine.Relaxed, light mouthfeel, no alcohol noticeable, where from? Gently sweet with saliva flow, the great smoky taste covers everything. Fine.The pleasantly soft disappears quickly and what remains is the light smoke with herbal aromatic impressions. Just pleasant, period."
1192,Connemara Original  Peated Single Malt,"Peach, pear, apple, all very ripe, it goes well with the fruits of the orchard. Thick honey. The peat is light, a little earthy, it's quite cereal, on wheat and puffed rice. A good dose of vanilla. Behind, floral essences, daisy, jasmine. A bit chalky. In the mouth, it is light, on cooked fruits. Malt, dry land. It's fresh, greenery, a hint of anise. Inconsistent finish, very short, with a slight return of greenery again. It's a bit dry. Anise returns after a while."

1196,Connemara Original  Peated Single Malt,"I can't say I liked the peaty Irishman; Ireland is good for its classic flavors, and beyond the peat, it's somewhere else.Unusual, grassy haze; there are mineral-tablet notes; aromas of lemon, apple, duchess are clearly perceptible.Continuation of the aroma, the bitterness of the herbal infusion; Irish themes make their way: vanilla, apple, pear; but everything is flat, there is not enough depth.Short, dry; smoke and lemon."
1197,Connemara Original  Peated Single Malt,"Very confusing flavors, in a bad way. Way too much grain, and weird smoky taste. I can't do anything with it and I really don't want to. I do make 'Irish coffee' with it."

1199,Kilbeggan Black   Irish Whiskey,"It doesn't challenge, it doesn't hurt, but overall it remains rather pale. The peated malt content could have been higher - and the home-grown Kilbeggan, the Rye and the Single Pot Still, with their 43%, show that only 3 percentage points more can make a difference.Very mild with fruity hints and notes that let the grain portion shimmer through. But not in such a way that it seems overwhelming, but rather well balanced. Woodier than the Kilbeggan standard, which is probably due to the peated malt. But really only lightly peated, you could overlook it if you didn't know.Also as mild on the palate as you would expect at 40%. Drought spreads quickly, and here the peated malt is more noticeable. Vanilla, honey, dry coniferous forest floor. Some toffee and caramel, roasted coffee beans, milk chocolate. A little pepper.Despite the peat, he's gone quickly. There is still a bit of woody dryness and spiciness, remnants of the vanilla, honey, and chocolate."

1206,Tyrconnell 10-year-old Madeira,"a lovely, very enjoyable whiskey, rather dessert – y in fact, so indeed the madeira influence plays its part. It's good, balancing on the edge of ‘very good’, but it’s not quite there in my book, mainly because the splendid nose is writing out checks the palate can’t always and fully cashwarm, rich, soft and sweet. Honey and marzipan lead the way, followed by conserved (tinned) fruit notes from apple and pear, developing into a syrupy sensation. Also quite some burnt sugar notes: caramel, toffee, treacle and sweet, and in the back ripe (blood)oranges. Quite the treat, in fact. A drop of water brought out more of a confectionery note but subdued the more ‘organic’ or ‘natural’ sweetness (i.e. the honey and fruit).This started off with a surprisingly sharp touch, luckily soon making way for honey, brown sugar, oranges and a faint hint of nuts. It didn’t deliver everything the nose promised, but here the added water did bring out a rather pleasant salty note to counterpart the sweetness, adding a bit of complexity.The finish again has a bit of sharpness to it. It’s quite long and syrupy before fading out on a dry note which, after the water, again gets some company from a pleasant salty touch that lingers on."
1207,Tyrconnell 10-year-old Madeira,"Tasting 47 days after uncorking.  It is no longer as fresh and fruity as when it was first met, but it is still very tasty, with a noticeable and delicious Madeira finish.  Takes a good 20 minutes in a Glencairn jar to open fully.

In addition, clear malty notes, vanilla sweetness and a little honey. Very reminiscent of MadeiraDelicious and tasty, velvety-fruity. ABV very well integrated. Memories of Madeira can also be felt well on the palate. In addition, a mild, rounded spiciness.

Fresh, citric and quite assertive, the aroma features a wide range of flavors. Lime, melon and litchi give way to heather honey, thyme and lavender. Tastewise, crisp and sour notes turn slightly bitter and herbal as the palate progresses, flanked by ginger, white pepper and a touch of banana.

Lo and behold: more than usable and not so flat and one-dimensional as feared. This is a Speyside that clearly shows what you commonly expect in Highland whiskys. The bottle will certainly soon be emptied in the circle of friends. I like it very much!At first he comes across quite malty, that's something he likes. In the background then flowers and honey nuts. And there is more (apples, melons?), Which is very complex and pleasant in the nose. You get a taste for it, it does not always have to be smoky. I like it very much!A bit of salt?

He has everything that shouldn't be. 40% / color / filter etc. But, I am pleasantly surprised and now I would say in terms of price-performance it does not need to hide. AND: He has an age.Smells very malty sweet towards honey breakfast. I'm surprised how pleasant it is on the nose. It is even slightly flowery. Respect.Wow, the distillery comes through straight away and stays spicy on the palate. Not bad Mister Specht. Salty and bitter peel off. Mouth remains covered with a little lemon and mild apple / pear (Helene sends her regards) Fully OK.Actually medium to long and delicately bitter but not unpleasant.

Something fresh oak, spicy malt, a very small piece of toffee, a pinch of pepper, a little mint.When the whisky has left the throat, there is a slight residual sharpness - along with hints of yellow fruit and some fresh wood.

Orchard fruits, pear skin, unripe banana, straw. There's something grassy/floral as well as quite a sulphuric / meaty aspect, à la Mortlach and/or Deanston: coal gas and barrel char. Not overly complex but very thick and substantial.Oily, buttery, weighty. Indistinctly fruity, grapey, like a good, strong grappa. Coal, charcoal, burnt logs. Something steely.

Quite suitable as every day dram.Starts with strong notes of apples, sometimes lightly fermented. Strong malt notes and some zest are without citrus. Sounds stupid, but it does. Is that sulfur? In addition, there is an intense herbal note. Crème Brulée is also to be found. What stays in the long run are herbs and Zest. Additional temperature produces artificially aromas and some dried fruit.Wow, what a start. Since I had not counted on the nose in the farthest with. Pretty sweet, herbs and a peppery pungency.

Spicy honey, lemon sorbet, very appetizing, but also a strong alcohol note.At first silky-soft, then something happens: the flow of saliva is stimulated enormously.

1242,Craigellachie 17-year-old  Batch No. 98-ZC21,"Yes. It is a work painting. I have to work hard to get it analyzed. The boy needs attention and time and water. It is significantly more intense in its aromas than the 13y brother. But I also find him less drinkable. Maybe it's not his concern. It really gets better with water. And also over time.While the 13-year-old was still in the light gold color range, the 17y is much darker in the rich rose gold. The legs slowly slide down oily.  Wow! The first time I take a sniff, I get a note of sulfur in the nose! I didn't have that with the 13er. I have never felt so clearly. I give the malt more time in the glass.  Slowly I get fruit and malt that are interwoven. With the fruit I'm not sure if I can get a mix of very ripe pears with some banana. In any case, the nose is full of aromas. It's hard for me to break them apart.  With a few drops of water, the malt opens up noticeably more. The smell takes on more malty, grainier nuances.I also have the sulfur in my mouth. But behind it a very clear spiciness. Strong start, slight tingling in the mouth. With water, it becomes more sweet and round in the mouth. Significantly better. And the sulfur disappears or I've already got used to it. The longer I have it in the glass, the better the nose!Slightly bitter on the finish. Now a little oak and the seasoning stays in the mouth a little longer. Also with water it changes in the finish, the grainy wort becomes milder but the oak more and remains palpable for longer."

Very creamy and buttery, with almond paste, some freshly grated coconut flakes, and a dash of good grappa - it's boozy in a good, unobtrusive way. Some wood spices and herbal notes come up last. Very nice, but also a bit soft (the strength, the strength...).Strong attack, sweet and sour, then becoming more oak-driven and herbal toward the end. A peppery edge that the 13-year-old, curiously, didn't have. This one is punchier even though it's older. Go figure! I like that the sherried and bourbon-matured components mesh really well, with no side standing out or even dominating. The components are really well married together. Plum wine, cookie dough, eukalyptus cough drops.A bit of heat, a bit of bitterness - the pear skins stage a return - and some sweet, sticky, syrupy sherry, which remained hidden on the palate. Not particularly fond of the latter as it adds a saccharine, aspartame-y feel. Loses a few points here."

1260,Craigellachie 23-year-old,"[September, 2019] Some members scored this 100 points so in their opinion no other malt can be better than this - what a bold statement! I for myself will never rate a dram a 100 points (except the last drop in my life) because always there is an option to find something even better than the best......and this is a great malt, no doubt (by the way, I taste the first batch from 2014). It offers a bold and flawless old Highland profile with a great complexity and perfect balance. No flaw or off-note, this is just delicious. But is this (close to) 100 points? Never ever, but 91 points is a great score for a 23-years old Craigellachie - no doubt. If only the price were more reasonable I would buy a bottle - but there are too many releases of a comparable profile and quality out there (for just half the bucks)...The colour is yellow gold and the nose offers an impressive old Highland style profile of a great complexity. There are fruits (grapefruit, limes), herbs, tea, honeys, waxes and a hint of cinnamon. Later some nuts (almonds) and earthy aromas join in without any off-note at all. This is both enjoyable and interesting to explore - let it breathe for some minutes to catch all impressions. The wood is firm but never enters the spotlight. A fine old-style nose, I like it!The taste is nicely layered on all the flavours which appeared in the nose already plus a delicious mocha impression that grows stronger from the middle of the taste onwards. This dram is greatly chewable and I strongly advice to do so - the spices grow stronger this way and pep up the taste further. Water releases even more aromas in the nose (among them limoncello) and turns the taste more quaffable but the tasty mocha impression is much weaker now. I like this dram both neat and somewhat reduced.The initial mouthfeel is warming and instantly coating without distracting moments. The finish is long and vanishes slowly in different fading waves, oh how I love that! It offers more waxy-earthy impressions that strengthen the old style character and improve the mouthfeel. No bitter or drying moments until the very end - this was a perfect casks selection (congrats to whoever did this)."

1262,Craigellachie 23-year-old,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deThe 23-year-old Craigellachie reveals his multi-faceted and interesting profile immediately after pouring. I give the malt enough time to breathe. The floral hints immediately remind me of flowering shrubs (lilac & roses) in my parents' garden. The sweet and light notes are additionally supported by light fruits, which discreetly drift off into the tropical spectrum. I register pears, grapefruit, juicy oranges, sugared pineapple and green apples. On the other hand, voluminous and powerful aromas dominate: dark forest honey, wax, milk chocolate, hints of biscuits with vanilla sugar, delicate red fruits (raspberries and blueberries), pipe tobacco, hints of leather and spicy oak wood. The nose looks wonderfully ripe and elegant, I almost dare to say that the confused flavors have something altogether timeless about them. I like it very well right from the start!With a very oily texture the craigellachie wets the entire oral cavity. A wonderful sweetness runs down the cheeks, while on the tip of the tongue a noticeable Pfeffrigkeit sets in and causes a pleasant tingling. After the sweet and peppery onset, more aromas gradually unfold: light fruits, such as sour apples, lemons and pears, a gentle hint of menthol, wax, dark forest honey, strong pipe tobacco, nuts, milk chocolate, some nougat, nutmeg, musty leather and noticeably spicy oak notes complete the aromatic variety. The palate already produces a slight dryness. Craigellachie also plays out its trumps in terms of taste: just under a quarter of a century of maturation time, the malt offers a great deal of elegance. The alcohol (46%) is perfectly integrated.Long, warm and sweet and spicy. At the beginning of the finish, a slight pepperiness flashes for the last time before the sweet fruits (now overripe) in combination with mint, wax and dark forest honey pick up again neatly. Spicy oak notes, marzipan and dark chocolate let the malt finish prudently. On the palate remains a slight, but always pleasant, dryness."
1263,Craigellachie 23-year-old,"Entirely complex, this malt tells me loads of interesting stories every time I sit back and listen to the flavours talking. Wonderful.Thyme blossoms and garden herbs, a slightly metallic note (think old brass), beeswax, suede, freshly-made bouillon.Fruity, sappy pine wood, a fragrant oiliness, honey, a dash of ground black pepper on dried Galloway beef.Herbs, old wood, slighty dusty attic, oiled leather."
1264,Craigellachie 23-year-old,"There are whiskys that leave the impression of ""healing properties"". He is one of them. All that he conjures up out of the glass is for many ""next to the topic"" or a ""no-go"" in the glass. For me just the opposite. There is tension in there, something special is happening. Here are the ingredients: pine resin, beeswax, menthol, nutty, smoky, spicy cinnamon, wood varnish, peppery, wild herbs, matches, tobacco, eucalyptus and mint. All in a glass of whisky. ... Yes, there it is, your grandma's old, dusty bottle of “medicine”. 7 drops given on sugar cubes. Reminder: e.g. ""Klosterfrau Melissa Spirit"" ... fabulous. No matter how I will distribute the points. I have to give him at least 90.Yessa, the unicorn! Hence the nouns at the top of the table of contents. Here are just the impressions. Old and interwoven notes of medical drug bottles in the basement next to the oil stove and a large box of damp matches on a leather rag. The citrus notes are a long time coming and then bring out everything that is fun. He smells like this bottle has been lying in grandma's spice cabinet for 50 years. But still everything is clear and elegant. Always accompanied by a bouquet of flowers. A nose without corners and edges. You can still play a little with water. It is worth it ..It continues with the same ancient oak cabinet as on the nose. For main words, please see above. Spicy oak determines this to happen. Everything in an oily, rich and very sweet, lively tingling texture at the edge of the tongue. With the first sip, the thought arises that you have something very healthy in your mouth. The spices dance tango on the tongue and palate. Immediately you are glad that you still have enough to refill. :) A big thank you to André from Whisky Evening!It ends medium to rather long. Again, the great sweetness is more in the background and yet everything is extremely pleasantly creamy, full and beneficial and always interwoven with fine coffee notes.

Then fermented notes outweigh darker fruits. Then warms up some sulfur, malt and garlic, as well as very light touches of soap. But also strong notes of vanilla and candied fruits.First lighter, then sweet-peppery start with honey, nuts, and unfortunately again some soap. Also some sweetener is included. Significantly strong notes develop.His full complexity he develops only in the finish. Notes of marzipan and herbs, again malt and now finally shows the oak, very restrained, however.

1269,Craigellachie 23-year-old,"Just had my very first sip of Craigellachie 23 (though I was nosing a lot yesterday - absolute brilliant old school nose, I must say). I will revise this review in a couple of days, but I start with it right away. This Whisky reminds me a bit of '73 Macduff (great compliment, indeed, but on the other hand it's not too close), but it has something prototypical that is lost in Whisky for quite some time (you could call it QUALITY), something, modern Whiskies fail to deliver - maybe the UMAMI of Whisky....Had I better Whiskies - yes. Is it rather pricey (even for nowadays standards)? Yes and no. It doesn't matter to me. The 91 points (rather pointless) are my way to at least try to be objective, here. But what does it mean anyway... This Whisky is absolutely unique.... at this time. So, I even understand those 100 points ratings. I could rate it even higher - as there is nothing to compare to it anymore anyway - as long as you aren't super-rich and be able to afford the good old stuff (ie. St. Magdalene - one of my all-time favorite distilleries, which literally no-one cared about until a couple of years, when the market produced the term of closed distilleries and the artificially made speculating began [following all the market rules of speculation| amongst others). So this is hope. A STANDARD bottling with flavors of real Whisky. I am glad - even for that price - that it exists... (almost lost) hope Whisky hasn't died yet completely.P.S. The body is a little bit on the thin side. Not too sure, whether a higher strength could help. But I really shouldn't complain about. P.P.S. Some reviews mentioned a sulfuric note. I am EXTREMELY sensitive in that regard (have given quite some bottles away, after opening them. Rotten eggs are not my cup of tea. So the rather very discreet notes that CONTAIN some sulfur aren't very present, here."

Dailuaine 16 is a Speysider with a singular style. Both intriguing and complex, the aroma features earthy sherry notes, plums and oranges, enriched by cocoa, dates and hints of rose water. Cherries, mint and emerging wood spices form the palate, supplemented by strawberries, herbal bitterness and a whisper of peat smoke in the lasting finish.

Savory sherry upfront, with lots of nuts, leather, dried fruit and rancio. Really unexpectedly deep and and rich sherry notes in here. Gets fruitier with time: cherry, peach, wild berries. Now there's also a floral / botanical side, which rounds things off nicely. I'm surprised - and impressed.Texture-wise, it's a bit thin, but the intensity and presence of flavors is really impressive at this low bottling strength. Begins with deep, jammy fruitiness, becoming then spicier and more herbal with lots of leather and tobacco from the sherried components, before the finish kicks off with pepper and brown sugar in tandem. Rich oak notes in here as well, making for some heavy chocolate and coffee flavors. It really seems as if some older casks had also gone into this batch.As weak as expected.

1286,Dallas Dhu 1970  Rare Malts Selection,"Enjoyable whisky and liquid history, obviously, but I have had much better Dallas Dhu. This one clearly has to many tannins. Today, the bottle has become all but unaffordable.The nose is waxy and even shows a bit of OBE in my opinion. I get furniture polish and silver shine before the fruit kicks in. That comes in the guise of apples, pears, kiwi and coconut. Slowly it evolves towards oranges with some grassy notes underneath.The arrival is, thanks to the high ABV, very powerful and surprisingly peppery. Loads of oak that offer nutmeg and cloves, but also quite some tannins I’m afraid to say. The fruit does get a chance though. Mostly oranges, now, but of the candied variety.The finish is long and dry on pepper and oranges."
1287,Dallas Dhu 1970  Rare Malts Selection,"I think of all the bottles I have purchased in the last 5 years this one for what I paid was one of the best. At 60% drinking neat is no problem and its so full bodied, great stuff.Thick & syrupy I suppose that sums up may Rare Malts bottles. Get one before its too late, that's my advice.My score of 91-92 remains, bottle kill, very sad it has all gone."
1288,Dallas Dhu 1970  Rare Malts Selection,"Just loveley....Dignified, slightly dusty, but with a good portion of honeyed malt, grass, vanilla (but not too much), orange blossom, melon, tutti frutti and a restrained note of coconut and hazelnut and an even more restrained note of (wood) smoke.Quite hot (softens with water), full bodied, with a creamy, oily texture. Honey, orange blossom, vanilla biscuit, chocolate rolls, tutti frutti, melon and hazelnut liqueur. It's all very pleasant!Long and lingering. Chocolate rolls, polished oak, soft spices, and a combination of greek yogurt with honey and dried fruits. "

A dash of pepper and oak faintly appear.Palate continues with creamy honey, oranges, a slight smoky note appears near the back of the palate.

Taste: combination of choclate and red fruits are lovely combination Finish: the finish can last pretty long with some nice sweet red fruits.Conclussion: i understand the chill filtration and 40% abv can be a downside to this whisky along with the caramel coloring.

1304,Dalmore 12-year-old,"Oh well. With only 40% ABV, heavy chill-filtration and added colorant, the presentation of Dalmore 12 could hardly be any worse. A shiny plastic stag alone does not make a good Single Malt! The nose, which is still the best part of the experience, features marzipan, Christmas spices and raisins with hints of fudge and citrus. Dark fruits, baked apple and zesty oranges dominate the palate, interrupted by tingly spiritiness. Notes of bitter tea, nutty dryness and eucalyptus remain of the short to medium finish. This Highlander could be so much better, if only...RATING: 3.0/5.0 stars ≙ 79 pts → AVERAGE"
1305,Dalmore 12-year-old,"Special case. I had already finished writing this note and then deleted it again. The rating was consistently too bad for me. Why? Since this whisky was my first at the time. I liked the design of the bottle so much that I bought it as the very first whisky. I'm not so sure anymore how good or bad it was for me back then, but I don't want to tarnish this great experience on ""DIE ERSTE BOTTLE"" with a bad tasting now. That's why I gave an average of 80 points. Now I'm being completely honest: I wouldn't buy this whisky anymore. But I should keep it in good memory. A matter of honor!"
1306,Dalmore 12-year-old,"Overall a very decent whisky. However, nowhere near as sherried as the colour (thanks to E150) may suggest. Personally, I find it overpriced for the quality. Value (£40) : 5/10Vanilla and caramels with the dark raisin and plum notes. There is also a slight musty note. Classic Dalmore chocolate oranges as well.Honeyed sweetness and dark raisin notes. Balanced off by some bitter tannins and oak spice. More of that chocolate orange note.Short finish, like the palate but less sweet and more spicy."
1307,Dalmore 12-year-old,"Serge Valentin / Whiskyfun""Dalmore 12 yo (40%, OB, +/-2018)I liked the 12 last year (WF 81). I usually find Dalmore’s distillate sumptuous, it’s just that it’s sometimes buried under tons of… ach, how shall we put this… under some thick stuff, shall we say. Colour: gold. Nose: caramel, chestnut purée, fudge, raisins, a wee touch of eucalyptus, roasted peanuts, gingerbread, nonnettes (that’s a wonderful specialty, it’s some kind of glazed gingerbread filled with honeyed marmalade). Mouth: I’ll tell you what, I really enjoy this, and they may well have further improved the recipe. Honey cake, chocolate, Cointreau, orange jam (not quite marmalade), Ovaltine, cinnamon rolls, brownies… What’s really striking is that it never feels weak or even lightish, despite the low strength. Finish: medium, very chocolaty. Wonderful nutty dryness that, indeed, hints at proper oloroso. Comments: up three points within one year, there! Never underestimate Dalmore, just avoid about their hyper-hyperbolic marketing flannel. It is a great whisky.SGP:551 - 84 points."""
1308,Dalmore 12-year-old,
1309,Dalmore 12-year-old,"It's a very ordinary taste. Only 40% alcohol, colored with caramel, condensed and filtered, The final result is a plain whisky with nothing to mention. The only advantage is probably the beautiful bottle. But looking at that price, it is too expensive and not worth it at all. Taste score 80 points, price minus 2 points, a total of 78 points."
1310,Dalmore 12-year-old,"Pleasant single malt with a pronounced sherry flavor, but sorely lacking in strength; all the delights of Dalmore washed away with water, I would hardly recognize the distillery in a blind tasting.Calm, warm; citrus and honey tones first; opens with raisins, red sweet apple, chocolate chips; in the background oak, coffee, spices.Pronounced sherry; dark fruits (cherries, peaches, plums); notes of roasted hazelnuts and coffee with chocolate are clearly perceptible; some oak, old leather and spices.Fairly short, slightly dry, slightly spicy; a little raisins, a little chocolate; at the end, oak bitterness remains."

Very traditional, sherried and ‘caramelised’, our old uncles will love it. Mouth: it’s not as ‘polished’ as I had expected, and rather more cerealy and bready. Croissants covered with marmalade and cherry jam. And raisins, naturally. Only the weakish strength is a wee problem, and makes it a little thin and slightly papery at times. On the other hand, this feeling of Mars bar and café latte is very pleasant. Finish: medium and appropriately grassier and more chocolaty. The marmalade is back in the aftertaste and would come with a touch of salt. Comments: a lovely dram for lovely chocolate and malt lovers. Probably full sherry. SGP:441 - 84 points."

1320,Dalmore 15-year-old,"Dalmore 15, 40%. Really dark colour- not convinced that's natural! Aroma is weird mousy oak, underripe raspberries, fruited cheap chocolate, soft with no spiritous harshness. Taste arrives in stages. To start it's very rounded oaky, old mousy oak, probably too oak dominant for my taste I thought to start. Blind I'd say this is a 40yo whisky. Then some coffeeish notes. Moving to milky coffee and touches of mint. Then chocolatey creamy oak. Silly stale biscuit oak. I mean I'm actually enjoying the silliness of the oak character. It's like drinking the essence of an old whisky cask. Then it builds such a deep chocolatiness that in the end it drinks like chocolate liqueur. This grew on me loads. Always seemed underpowered though and could really benefit from a higher bottling strength. (3.65/87)"

Marzipan and dark chocolate and some nutmeg. No sherry-bomb!Full on juicy oranges, reminiscent of Cointreau (triple sec). Some nectarines and figs add to the fruitiness before a dried herbs and more nutty notes appear. Some marzipan again. Very nice!Rather full with tangerines and oranges.

1341,Dalmore King Alexander III,"I finally have him in my glass, the Dalmore King Alexander III. Most of you probably know the almost legendary videos from Master Blender Richard P., how he swirls whisky in a glass and then pours it on the carpet, dilutes his already too diluted whisky with more water and then sticks his nose into the glass. I just say ""Hello ... how are you?"". This whisky is in the higher price segment (150+ euros), has only 40% alcohol content and is also colored and without indication of age. Actually, that would be enough reasons for me to avoid this whisky. But 6 different barrels in a whisky, that makes you curious. And there are also many whisky lovers who praise this whisky in the highest tones. Let's see what the Dalmore King Alexander III offers and whether I like it.  The presentation looks quite nice. A nice box and a bottle with an impressive deer emblem and a dark whisky, the dye did a great job (sorry, it had to be now).  In the nose, the Dalmore is initially stronger than I would have expected with only 40% alcohol. Aromas of dates, raisins, plum jam, figs and cherries immediately come out of the glass. A heavy, dark fruitiness combines with a great honey sweetness with vanilla sugar and then spices such as pepper and cinnamon as well as clear oak flavors come through immediately and give the whole thing a spicy-woody touch. I hear notes of dark chocolate with fruit, similar to the Lindt chocolate with raspberry filling. There is a lighter fruitiness with mirabelle plums, apricots and oranges over the rather heavy flavors. A touch of leather and tobacco round off the variety in the nose and I have to say that I have enjoyed the Dalmore King Alexander III so far. Unfortunately, the wood goes too much in the direction of the Bauhaus wooden beams and is too dominant.  In the mouth the whisky is quite soft as expected, but still has a stronger start than I would have expected. Pepper and a slight ginger spiciness are clearly noticeable and while the fruitiness and honey sweetness spread, the tannins from the oak barrels are more and more present and the dark chocolate tends to move towards espresso. Tobacco and leather provide further bitter aromas, a slight bitterness is noticeable. Associations with wet forest floor and wet wood arise, but fortunately only discreetly and in the end when it comes to the finish. The whisky looks watered down. It is quite sharp at the start and the alcohol content on the tongue seems hardly chosen too low. But the strength, the fullness, the intensity are missing.  The finish is medium long with strong spiciness and tannins of the oak barrels. Tobacco, leather, some wet wood and chewed coffee beans make for a very slight bitterness. In the background the fruitiness and heavy sweetness resonate, but the tart notes set the tone here.  Overall, I liked the whisky in the nose and in the mouth solala. This light touch of wet wood, tobacco or forest floor bothers me a little here. In the mouth, the whisky is watered down and comes out sharp and strong on the tongue, but it lacks the fullness in the mouth and the intensity of the aromas. The only great thing about the low alcohol content is that you could ""chew"" the whisky in your mouth for 5 minutes without it burning in your mouth.  The whisky gets almost 85/100 points from me. A whisky that is so gentle that it could also please non-whisky drinkers ... but the tannins may then be too violent for non-whisky drinkers. And the price? Well ... for comparison: I recently had a Glenlivet SV in the glass, which only cost 2/3 of the Dalmore, but is in a higher league ... or 2 leagues higher. Therefore: No purchase recommendation for this price!  Addendum: The bottle is now only half full and the oxygen seems to do the Dalmore good. The wood is no longer in the Bauhaus direction and there is hardly any wet wood left. In the mouth it doesn't look as watered down as before. Of course, it will not be an intense whisky with the alcohol content, but overall it looks rounder and a bit fuller than before. Overall, I like it better now, so I'll adjust the rating accordingly:  Smell: 88 instead of 87 points  Taste: 85 instead of 83 points  Departure: 85 instead of 84 points  Overall: 86 instead of 85 points"
1342,Dalmore King Alexander III,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deThe first nose is predominantly characterized by sweet sherry flavors and surprisingly intense (""only"" 40% alcohol content). Dark dried fruits dominate, especially raisins I perceive throughout. A good portion of plum jam, cherries, blueberries, caramel and orange peel set further accents. The abundance of aromas is enveloped by noticeable spicy wood flavors, old leather, sweet pipe tobacco and red grapes. From time to time dark chocolate notes flash in the background. The aroma is very harmonious and complex.The beginning shows the very soft texture of the Dalmore. Relatively dry, intense sherry notes make a first exclamation point. Dark fruits dominate at first (cherries, plums, preserved raisins, blueberries) with a fine caramel note and a hint of ripe citrus fruits. Strong-spicy wood flavors, leather, sweet pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, nuts (macadamia) and roasted almonds follow quickly. The alcohol content of 40% is perfectly integrated. The variety of flavors comes to the fore - with 46% -48% the whisky would certainly be a bit ""better / more interesting"".Medium long, chocolaty-spicy. The dark fruits gradually leave, so that the spicy aromas quickly take over the tastefulness. Cloves, cinnamon, leather, plenty of dark chocolate, cocoa and spicy oak notes follow. A slight dryness remains on the palate."
1343,Dalmore King Alexander III,"Many complain that something is missing and that it is too simple. Also because of. Some of the 40% are moaning. But I have to say NO, it still comes across very well. A great whisky if it weren't for the price. Because the PLV doesn't fit at all. The oldest barrel definitely not older than 10 to 13 years. And then colored. Phew. Sorry Dalmore.You can find your way around here immediately. It is slightly relaxed and flatters with subtle notes of sherry. It remains fruity and pleasantly soft. Dry nutty direction and sweet tobacco in a real leather pouch. A solid nose. Respect.Immediately you have absolutely extra dry dark fruits with a slightly creamy but rather thin body on the palate. In the mouth it looks much older than on the nose. Dark berries keep the taste buds awake. Actually, I like that a lot. Can't say exactly why. If I can get it anywhere for <100EUR, I'll strike. Might become a house whisky.Medium long and quickly gone, .... unfortunately! A little cocoa and liquorice are left over. Very inconspicuous, but always sweet. Already OK."
1344,Dalmore King Alexander III,"I am pleasantly surprised not this Dalmore, not that it corresponds to the profile that I seek, but especially that as a whole all this remains coherent and rather good. We can logically complain about the reduction at 40%, it's still a lot / too much! Another black point is the price, more than 100 €, I pass my turn!A nose rather greedy and very pleasant, quite complex and faithful to what I imagined. We are on mint, citrus fruits, mainly lemon and grapefruit. After a few moments the (s) were (s) of Sherry take again the hand on the dried fruits and on the winey side (red fruits).Well, there is no doubt, the reduction is clearly felt. A light and watery attack. The mouth quickly becomes oily on light spices, dried fruits and vanilla. In the end we are on the bitterness and the woody.Medium length, very round on dried fruits, vanilla, malt and biscuit. Rather nice and pastry chef."

1347,Dalmore King Alexander III,"King Alexander III is so nearly a triumph. The nose is delightful and welcoming, the arrival (especially for 40% ABV) is an explosion of wonderful flavours, the mid-palate a well-balanced melange of complex fruits and spices. But, the lack of any substantive finish at all means that as soon as your taste buds have got to the party, your mother turns up and drags you away from it. This hollowness is a real shame as everything else about this whisky screams both quality. Nevertheless, don’t let this criticism put you off entirely, this whisky is still a masterclass of cask selection and blending skill.https://www.thedramble.com/tastings/dalmore/dalmore-king-alexander-iii/Terry’s Chocolate Orange! Make no mistake, this is an exquisite nose – opening with oranges, tangerines alongside raisins, figs and toffee, this moves quickly into milky chocolate, buttery biscuit (base) and hazelnuts. There’s tangy citrus running right through this – not just orange, also some limes – with some gentle florals in the background it reminds me of a well stepped herbal tea.A glorious arrival of booze-soaked orange segments, foamy latte (not flat white though) and hot chocolate. Toffee, golden syrup and honey. On the mid palate, raspberries come out to play and are joined by creamy trifle and salted almonds. Bakery notes – flans and tarts, along with spices (cloves in particular) add some bitterness that balances excellently with the sweeter fruits and more sugar-driven flavours. But then…Disappointingly short. The riot of delicious flavours don’t gentle fade away – they fall off a cliff – some chocolate and dry spicing here, but sadly it all feels slightly empty when compared to the wonderful palate."
1348,Dalmore King Alexander III,
1349,Dalmore King Alexander III,"Heavy sherry aromas flow from the nosing glass: blood orange, peach, dried fruit, woody, very voluminous and elegant. Every now and then, marzipan, vanilla, chocolate and spices shimmer through. For a Dalmore it seems too ""clean"" to me, blindly I would have thought of Tamdhu or Glenallachie. In the mouth it is very intense for the very low alcohol content, a few older barrels have definitely gone into it. At the same time chocolaty and spicy. The finish lines the entire mouth with aromatic oak and dried fruits, which last for a relatively long time. Very chocolatey towards the end. Length: 6/10 Perfect Christmas painting that proves that even NAS and 40% can be fun. Note 1-"
1350,Dalmore King Alexander III,"Dalmore King Alexander III, 40%. Very dark colour. Aroma is milky oak, slight tinned peach, quite oaky rather than fruity. Slightest bit mousy. Taste is very juicy, a touch over-watered-down perhaps - a common complaint for Dalmore, lots of berry fruit, lots of spice into the finish. Warming rich juicy rounded fruit, loads of balance. No rough edges here at all it's all luxurious subtle and rich and then the finish becomes more spicy and oaky with cinnamon and clove. Importantly for my tastes this is not all just sherry - it has more spice and biscuity notes. The oak isn't overdone it's just supportive. Yeah the flavour is very good. Wasnt expecting it to be as good as it is. Pity it's so expensive. (3.85/92)"

1352,Dalmore The Quintet,"With this Dalmore it is not clear to me what they actually wanted to achieve. Sometimes a lot is not enough. For the price there is better in the Dalmore standard range.The nose is rather closed, dark, leather, tobacco, some red berries. More Madeira and Port comes through than Sherry. The aroma is a bit washed out.Difficult to define, clearly spicy, little fruit and sweetness. Here too, Madeira stands out for me. Much wanted, but little meaningful achieved.Amazingly short, at most medium-long and not very complex, rather pale."
1353,Dalmore The Quintet,"The Dalmore The Quintet is part of a series of whiskys that owe their creation to a combination of distillates that have matured in different barrels. The name of the whisky, Quintet, refers to five barrels that form the basis of this Dalmore whisky. In addition to Moscatel and Madeira barrels, 30-year-old Matusalem sherry barrels, 10-year-old port barrels and former Cabernet Sauvignon barrels were used for this. This special barrel composition gives The Dalmore The Quintet many layers of exotic fruits, syrupy, sweet notes, herbal aromas and the taste of fresh coffee. This and more awaits you when you have this whisky by the glass."

1362,Deanston 12-year-old,"(Tasted 01.03.2019)NOSE: Already straight out of the bottle, this smells nicely of serious whisky with an initial nose of malt, minerals, iodine and light smoke. Like a cousin of Springbank. After some minutes the smoke disappears while iodine and malt takes over. It is a sweet biscuity maltiness. Then there are lemons. And the light smoke returns. Then more sweet maltiness. Engine oil and engine room. With a few drops of water: more lemon and malt. (89p)Initial TASTE: The arrival is slightly oily, then ginger, black pepper and salt.BODY: The oiliness enriches the body of this malt, which is quite sweet and rounded on the mid palate.

Some apricot and melon with cooked pears and bananas. Overall the bourbon influence is clearly present here with a heavy oak note. I wonder if there were some recharred barrels included as well.Creamy mouthfeel. Very obvious honey and vanilla notes with barley water. Slightly bitter orange peels balance this out well with a bright tangy lemon note. Cooked apples now. A touch of black pepper warmth and some drying wood tannins. At 12 years of age, I think some rather active casks were used here as the oak influence is quite pronounced.More of the same from the palate here. Slightly more black pepper spice but all the oak and honeyed citrus peels come through along with more vanillins."

Quite viscous, noticeable long, slim legs on the side of the glass.NOSE: Dried fruits, mainly yellow; dried mango, dried banana. Waxy. Mineral notes, direction oils and metal, fresh engine oil. With time also some red dried fruits arrive. I think there must have been sherry or other wine casks in the mix here. A few drops of water opens it up a little more, emphasising the mineral aspect more. (88-89p)TASTE: The arrival is quite rich, red dried berry kind of fruity. On the mid palate there’s sweet barley juice (but darker than in the 15) and forest honey. With a few drops of water it becomes sweeter and full of sweet barley juice.

1370,Deanston 12-year-old,"After Ralfy named this ""Whisky of the year"", I bought a bottle. Unfortunately a disappointment.

Buy BenRiach, Benromach or Mackmyra's ""Brukswhisky"" instead."
1371,Deanston 12-year-old  Un-Chill Filtered,"Certainly a whisky that tastes different. And 'different' is nothing for everyone ...  Taste descriptions I save myself at this point. I think enough experts have commented on this malt; The notes are sometimes as contradictory as they could be.  What do I mean by that?  To all newbies, put on a sample and judge for yourself. Or buy at this joke but still a bottle.  Maybe it's even the price that was the fate of whisky, because no one dares to miss such a malt many points.  'What do the aficionados think if I give 85 points to this whisky?' It feels a bit wrong to find a cheap malt or it?  I give nothing on prices, standing or anything else - from me there are 88 points! Would I include in my ratings the PLV with it would probably ü90 ..  This malt represents Deanston as an original bottling flagship must. And yes; it may be that he does not taste you; Tastes are different; but not to try it because of the low ratings (the experts here) would be wrong!  For me, the best whisky you can buy for 32 €! And one of the sweetest in the taste anyway ...  Cheers!"
1372,Deanston 12-year-old  Un-Chill Filtered,"Some Scottish distilleries are fairly average at best. However, given a craft presentation, the intrinsic quality of a previously overlooked Single Malt can improve significantly. Deanston 12 is a good example. Floral honey, breakfast cereals and whiffs of fresh oak characterize the nose. It’s soft, fresh and almost Irish with lots of 'green' notes. The taste unfolds strong and biscuity with vanilla fudge, sour citrus and hints of cough syrup. Straightforward, mildly bitter and gingery sweet in its long finish, this Cinderella malt proves to be highly underestimated.RATING: 3.5/5.0 stars ≙ 84 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE"

1375,Deanston 12-year-old  Un-Chill Filtered,"Liquid Gold - if Deanstone 12 would have been a woman, that woman would be Megan Fox. Would you like to give it a try?The purity of the nose is superb. It starts with a subtle sweetness of malted barley, grainy, rich, golden. Rippen fruit coats the caramelized vanilla that builds up in the back. The vapors develop to Galic Mellon, over ripped pears, and hints of golden apple. It's composed, energizing, rich, and full of flavor. It retains the distillery profile, while the 12 years in wood, only reshape the contour of this wonderfully balanced spirit.It develops fast, once unfolded, explodes with spices, hotness, ripe fruit, apple peel, pear, banana notes, and the illusion of sweetness. It feels sweet the first seconds, but then it fades away, in dryness, changes context, becomes round but aggravated. the vanilla - caramel combo, is refreshing, while the spices pour liquid damped fire on your mouth. it a pleasant, surprise from the nose to palate.The long wonderfully balanced finish reminds me of a hot summer day.. golden apples and a cold beer.

1382,Deanston 18-year-old,"Deanston is one of those distilleries that grabbed itself by the boot straps at the exactly right moment, and did almost everything right.And to top it off they don't make too much fuzz of it.The 12YO is good, the 15 even better, so I was really looking forward to this 18YO sample from karloff.Delicate, unusual, interesting.Sweet, toasted wood vanilla.Strawberries with custard.Juicy melon with a twist of lemon and a pinch of spice.And karloff is spot on with the floor laminate. That's the unusual thing that struck me right away.For anyone that have done home improvement it is a familiar and very pleasing smell.Mouthfeel is light, but with a very firm texture.Citric fresh with a good dollop of spice. Not in any way overwhelming, just enough to excite.Orange chocolate. Lightly salt licorice.A sort of controlled transition from a fresh arrival to something bolder at the swallow.Fairly long, and just slowly fading.Again calm and very controlled. This whisky had it's course set from the moment it was poured, it knew where it was heading. I just leaned back and enjoyed the scenery."
1383,Deanston 18-year-old,"This is another great whisky from Deanston and again reasonably priced. This will stick in my mind for some time because when I got back home from having my dog put down I opened this and drank half of it. It helped with the grief and the sleep, plus it tasted damn good. Not a bad send off for the big lad. XLovely nice fresh oak ,banana, white sugar, Dolly mixture sweets. This really is a treat to the senses. After nosing powerful peat all day this would be a spar treatment for the nose. Honey Dew Mellon, laminated flooring and a new book.It says a few things on the label, some i disagree with and some i don't like barley sugar, spiced ginger bread and white pepper. Again the 46.3% is spot on and no water needed. Fresh and spicy on the palate, a real summer treat even when it is cold outside and pissing down. Just close your eyes, dream and sip. Things keep coming like liquorice root, citrus, white chocolate and a herb like oregano.From start to finish this is fresh and spicy. A bit dry at the death but that is okay because the flavours are still there and stick around until it almost turns into butterscotch."
1384,Deanston 18-year-old,"One of my best ever whisky experiences was with the Deanston 18. I was travelling in Scotland, staying by Loch Morar, Scotland’s deepest lake. I had two bottles of whisky with me for the trip - a small bottle of Clynelish 14 (okay), and an even smaller 5cl sample from my first ever bottle of Deanston 18. I was sitting in a warm room, looking out onto the lake being battered by a deluge of rain coming in from the Atlantic. It felt like an appropriate moment to pour a dram of the Deanston. Mind blown. Something about the singular, honest character of that whisky, at that place and that time just resonated with me. It has never tasted as good since, but I’m happy to get close.The headline is: if you enjoy a classic malty highland whisky, the Deanston 18 is amazing value at below 60 GBP. Buy some, and then buy some more.Tasting notes:This one shows it’s age in the initial woodiness - if you don’t let it breathe for at least 20 minutes, you’ll have a bad time. While the 18 retains Deanston’s malty character, it is a completely different beast from the 12. The 12 is open, a bit spiky, with a variety of easily identifiable notes flying about. In the 18 everything has melded into a dense, cohesive whole. Many may prefer the 12, but the 18 going for a completely different experience worth seeking out for its own sake.A very candied nose. Caramel, gingerbread, dry earthy wood (with slight tinges of green, reminding me of bark and moss - dry forest notes). Rich, spiced honey, pretty hints of floral rosewater, honeyed oat biscuits. All of these delicious notes balance the earthy wood in a brilliant way, keeping the overall experience light and enjoyable. Some dry ginger and soft citrus (orange and lemon peels).In the mouth, the Deanston is lighter than expected from the notes, light to medium bodied. Incredibly malty in the arrival, it’s like drinking oat biscuits, so good! A surge of honeyed fruit is followed by a balanced build-up of spice. Finish, is mostly woody notes."
1385,Deanston 18-year-old,"Cream soda coupled with fruit gum!Mostly tangerine and yuzu. Then lot of bergamot, and cream soda! A little bit fish brine kept floating in the back.

The aroma is very good, classic bourbon extract, the aroma goes in the fruity-herbal direction. As for me, the reference fragrance for this type of exposure. The taste is good, light, field herbs and wax, very drinkable, light bitterness. In conclusion, we have a beautiful classic malt, which lacks nothing, with a good degree and endurance. I'm more of a fan of double helmets and endurance, but if you take a purely ex-bourbon helmets, then everything went well."
1388,Deanston 18-year-old,"Best nose of the core range, in my opinion. Falls a bit short on the palate and finish, but overall really good.

Tutti frutti fruitiness beneath the surface.In the mouth it turns to the undefinable mush more commonly known as balance. Put differently, the elements that were easy to pick out on the nose are more difficult to rediscover on the palate. Slight let-down.

1393,Deanston 18-year-old  Un-Chill Filtered,"Deanston is owned by Burn Stewart distillers which in turn is owned by South African company, Distell. Distill’s home brands include it’s ‘Three Ships’ single malt and ‘Bains’ grain. Back in Scotland, [Distell’s] Burn Stewart’s leading blended Scotch is Black Bottle & Scottish Leader whilst Scottish distilleries in their portfolio include Bunnahabhain and Tobermory. Deanston of late has had some serious re-investment including the opening of a visitors centre in 2012. Furthermore their core range currently [2016] consists of singe malts and vintages, bottled non-chill filtered at 46.3% with age statements - so on paper they are showing serious intent. Whilst the NAS WB showed more the distillate, let’s see what decent maturation can do to the spirit. This 18yo has seen 16 years in bourbon before being finished [or re-racked] for 2 years in oloroso.N: Mushroomy malt [from the cask surely], leathery too with smelly socks accompanying - but that'll subside as the whisky opens up.T: Theres a touch of jam [from the oloroso I would have thought], and that finish has proved valuable. Underlying and representing those first 16 years however is that bourbon-oak-fungal which is rather fine.F: Bring on head nodding and some ‘dad noises’. Nutty, malty tannins permeate the palate for a long finish with that fungal oak there to the last.C: Meant to go back and try it again later in the day. Will visit this a bit later on in the year. On first impressions I think this is fab.Scores a BA revisit came sooner than i thought, just two weeks later.N: Consolidated nose [Glengoyne like]. The sherry no doubt has had a significant influence in tying it all together.T: Lots of sherry at first but its the 16 years of bourbon that make all the headlines.F: Yet, ‘stop press’ - the finish is worth a line or two also. Bubblegum [from the bourbon no doubt] into creamy cream moving to white chocolate caramac.C: Whatever we thought of past bottlings in the late 1900’s [doesn’t that sound archaic?], in 2016 Deanston is darn decent.Scores a B[-]"

1415,Deanston Virgin Oak,Costs almost nothing. And it's adequately bad. Not much different than the 12 y old. I just find that distillery products too sweet and hard on the head afterwards. The interesting thing about htis one is that it's taste develops to worse with the time. At the openening the plastic smell of paint characteristic for immature low quality whiskies was not there.

1419,Deanston Virgin Oak,Too floral and young. The only good thing was the price abroad.

Rating: 77  Bottom line: although the aroma is rustic, it is rather pleasant, the taste and finish are descending.

1457,Ballechin 10-year-old  The Discovery Series,"Serge over at Whiskyfun has this at 89 points... I wouldn't go that far, but I'll say this is certainly underrated. Performs better (and seems older, or at least, more mature) than its stated age would have you suspect. Good balance between the different cask types as well as between spirit and wood. Recommended at under 40 €...A soft but ""dark"" nose, as if both ex-sherry and heavily charred ex-bourbon casks had been used. Lots of roast aromas (coal, ash, char, coffee etc.) alongside a soft, jammy fruitiness - mainly red berries. The smoke is there, but it, too, is rather soft and never dominates. In a sense, this is a unicorn: a well-balanced, harmonious malt from idiosyncratic Edradour. Okay, there's still a farmy aspect to the smoke, but overall, this borders on the dreaded ""smooth."" I'm actually not mad at this! Pretty decent for its price segment.Very (and I mean: very) soft on arrival. Sweet and spicy initially, with the smoke coming up big about halfway through and the wild berries and red-fruit jams wafting along in the background. Again: not half bad! Super sippable and lusciously sweet, but a residual bitterness in the background (acrid smoke) prevents it from getting outright cloying.More than okay for its age. Of course the peat smoke lingers the longest, but it's accompanied for a good long while by earthy, herbacious notes and soft but lovely echoes of juicy refill sherry casks."

You have to like it - I'm not sure here yet ^^  Taste: sparkling fresh with lemon, again this fierce yeasty notes, warm glowing smoke, ashen and dry when swallowing, an aroma of smoked meat and grill spice spreads in the mouth, a hint of sweetness comes through and mixes with the warm ash to a medium-long finish.  Something completely different but you have to feel like it. For me certainly nothing to drink every day (Ok that should not make anyway ^ ^).

1467,Edradour 10-year-old  The Distillery Edition,"Based in Pitlochry and owned by independent bottler Signatory Vintage, Edradour remains one of the smallest distilleries in Scotland.

It is neither the sweet maltiness, paired with oranges and spices, nor the soft and creamy character. There is something sharp and herbaceous that is hard to pin down.

Not a huge amount if complexity but pleasant enough all the way through. Light background old bitter woodiness like one or two old third-use casks sneaked in among the good casks.

It has some edges of course that not everyone seems to like - I do it's subjective and maybe it's good that it's not so mainstream ;)...for people who haven't tried this it's profile is best described as something between a mild Speyside malt and a Springbank malt - if you don't like this stay away from Springbank ( please stay away from Springbank).

Here you get high average for a fair price. Well balanced like the PLV, it then goes into the last round. He persevered ... respect!Burnt sugar over all sorts of mixed sherry notes, including a touch of leather & tobacco. He starts very sweetly and stays warm. Water helps. You get delicious fruits that are rare in this price range and age. It only takes a little time here, then this nose is not to be despised.There is a very beautiful body in the mouth. With sweet vanilla he makes the hot nose disappear again. Tasty, spicy and sweetly sour, it underlays the earthy wood tanine that dance on the tongue. Ok ... you have to like this texture. Not for everyone. But especially!Medium to long and sweet with ripe fruits, it is spicy with an earthy touch of wood. Refilling is the order of the day. And that means something. Really well done for a 12cc."
1480,Edradour 12-year-old  Caledonia Selection,"When Ralfy scored this a generous 91 points he did so with the caveat that it was different and not for beginners. This seems to be reflected in the spread of scores here on WB which depict an especially wide bell curve. Without water the nose is overly dense, the sherry influence is already there but it is not particularly impressive. Ralfy added two full teaspoons of water to his dram and indeed a generous addition of water opens this whisky up immensely. The sherry springs to life with a very fine, dried fruit flavour, with no hint of syrup or too many raisins. The palate also reflects a very fine sherry flavour along with some hints of breads and particularly some lapsang souchong in the background. I am no fan of sulfur but this is very slight. I'm not sure I can follow Ralfy in calling this a masterpiece but I do find it to be a rather enjoyable sherried whisky."

1484,Edradour 12-year-old  Caledonia Selection,"The glass reveals a thick and strong aroma. Yep, this is a sherry whisky with a strangely interesting aroma that clouds spectacularly into a glass after a drop of water - promising.The aroma smells like winey berries, ginger, chocolate, oranges, honey, vanilla, yeast, some bread, and a hint of licorice. There's a lot of small hints of different aromas that I can't quite seem to grasp. The same soft chocolate, orange, and cinnamon continue in the palette, and the aftertaste does not have the slightest hint of smoke or peat. The mere fruitiness carries surprisingly far, and gives a good opportunity to focus on it without smoke and peat. 86 points."
1485,Edradour 12-year-old  Caledonia Selection,Ralfy and Gwhisky gave this 91 points. Sorry but I cant agree with that. Far from a great or spectacular whisky as some have tried to insinuate. Not as rich or dense as they say. A bit harsh (alcoholic) on the palate aswell.
1486,Edradour 12-year-old  Caledonia Selection,"Dark on the nose and sherry fruity. Compared to the ""independently"" bottled 10-year-old less alcoholic and therefore rounder, more chocolatier and spicier, the teen note is missing. Meets my taste a little better. Relatively dry in the mouth, especially compared to the 10. Also a bit milder, but spicier. In the finish I find the association with black tea, also fermented fruits and espresso, everything in interplay. At first I don't find the soapy notes of the 10th.

Unfortunately, the nose is a bit weak on the chest and does not have a lot of volume, too little depth Initially broadly sweet in taste, then transitioning to a spicy pepperiness to a pleasantly bitter finish. Many nut flavors then delight in the medium-long finish."

1500,Fettercairn 16-year-old  2nd Release 2021,"In batch 1, I had a crazy journey through various fruit gardens in my mouth. With this expectation, Batch 2 disappointed me bitterly. I don't notice him for 16 years.Sour and slightly musty on the nose. Delicately vanilla behind.Rather flat, then dry bitter. Not uncomfortable but insignificant.Bright, dry, light wood. Short to medium long."
1501,Fettercairn 16-year-old  2nd Release 2021,"The first nose shows fresh citrus notes with sweet dried plums and a hint of hazelnuts. A very subtle note of vanilla creeps up in the background. It starts out very sweet on the tongue, then spreads slightly peppery over the wings of the tongue. In my mouth I mainly have the dried plums again. Towards the finish and far in the aftertaste, roasted hazelnuts are very present. They stay on for so long that you can sit there smacking your lips 5 minutes later - wonderful."
1502,Fettercairn 22-year-old,"I didn’t know what to expect from this dram as I had read mixed reviews (some eulogistic, some way less so) about previous Fettercairn releases. Participating in this tasting was the occasion for me to start making my own opinion, tasting their juice myself. And what a pleasant surprise it was. I love tropical fruits, especially pineapple and passion fruits, and I have been more than satisfied here. The nose takes its sweet time to open but is very fruity once it does, and the palate cranks those fruits to eleven. This is very tasty. The nose is too shy, but it’s still pretty good whisky, no doubt. I’ll expect good things of the next ones I’ll be able to taste.A bit closed at first even after a good moment in the glass, but I’m getting fresh laundry, hay, orchard fruits (peach, apricot), tropical fruits (pineapple, mango and a couple passion fruits) and vanilla.Way more open than the nose. Orchard and tropical fruits (especially over-ripe passion fruits) from the nose are here with a bang, citrus-a-plenty, coffee beans, then it moves to the bitterness of grapefruit and raw wood.Citrus, ginger, passion fruits, vanilla and oak, with a medium length."

1527,Glen Garioch 12-year-old,"The sherry influence tends to vary from batch to batch. My first bottle was noticeably more bourbon-based, while the 1-liter-travel-retail bottling I have going right now is pretty ""dark"" in character.Acidic / tart / mineralic in character. Lime zest, sour fruit gums, hay, chalk, gravel, wet pebbles. An austere style that may scare off the uninitiated. Well sherried, a lot of cask influence, pretty spicy. Pretty complex for a 12-year-old OB.Intense, the strength works wonders at 48%. Great mix of tart fruit notes (lime, redcurrant), floral impressions (elderberry, lilac), and minerality.Still on the tart/sour side. A bit uneventful, with oak galore."

In fact ""light"", but nicely varied: malt, some honey sweetness, fresh citrus notes, vanilla, with (herbal? -) seasoning. By the time I think of dark fruits - raisins and plums - to find.Oha, at the beginning almost spicy and peppery on the tongue. The longer it is in the mouth, the more the fruity notes come through: now orange, a little raisin, honey, a hint of cough drops.Fruit notes and sweetness fade quite soon, leaving behind strong espresso and bitter notes that occupy the palate and tongue."

I have had a couple of bottles of this over the past years I feel I can now review the liquid with some precision. It does indeed convey a classic sherry profile, but not soaked in red fruits and sugar. You do get some notes, especially in the taste that are reminiscent of 15 or even 18 years in a good cask. A great malty sherried speysider, at good strength, not chill filtered, but likely coloured, so not full marks. Very good value for money in the big 100cl bottles I have had the fortune of obtaining at less than 45€ - and at that price its a no brainer.Bready malt meets red fruits right away. Slight ripe banana, cereal, brown sugar. Some warm spices and oak sap, and even some lemon zest freshly peeled.Lemon juice, strawberries, red berries in general.

A true old-school sherry whisky. This is primarily due to the rich oak tones and tannins that he was able to absorb from the barrels in the 15 years.Heavy and sweet on the nose and he makes no secret of his coming out of the sherry barrel. He starts immediately with a deep dark spice, old leather, heavy sweet pipe tobacco, juicy dried plums, raisins, vanilla, strong oak notes, brown cane sugar, cinnamon, cloves, despite cask strength little alcohol,Here you can feel the cask strength already clearer, the alcohol comes with a sharp start and pushes sweet spicy ripe fruit and red berries in front of it, along with a few floral notes and again pipe tobacco, salivation, dried fruit, strong tannins from the European oak after and after the salivationIn the rather long and warm finish mainly a nice spicy malt sweetness, pickled raisins and still sweet tobacco hang - I have the feeling, myself to have smoked a fresh pipe."

Put together very harmoniously. Masterpiece.The full range of spicy oak with powerfully integrated sweet berry elements. Cinnamon sticks in orange jam. Honey with cloves. In the transition you go towards the tobacco pouch on the leather saddle. In summary: a Christmas poem.Medium to long, it keeps what it promises in the finish. Slightly peppery oak leaves the stage with a glass of plum compote. One thing is now present: ""He is special!"""
1540,Glen Garioch 15-year-old  Sherry Cask Matured,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deSweet and heavy Sherrynoten stand out powerfully from my glass. Behind the intense sherry influence hides a variety of flavors, which gradually crystallize during nosing: dark berries, plums, raisins, forest honey, chocolate, hints of leather and tobacco, Christmas spices, slightly burnt bread crust, roasted aromas, nuts and oak spice I perceive. In the background, a subtle note of sulfur drives its mischief. The high alcohol content (53.7%) is immediately noticeable immediately after pouring, but overall it is still well integrated.Powerful and sweet-spicy detonate the intense sherry freight on the palate. A pleasant sweetness runs down the cheeks, while on the tip of the tongue a noticeable Pfeffrigkeit sets in and (in the short term) causes a decent tingle. Mountain-like dark fruits are rapidly gaining dominance. Wild berries, plums and raisins are again present and mix with dark chocolate, spicy oak and Christmas spices. Leather, hints of tobacco, very light sulfur and beautiful rust flavors enhance the aromatic variety with walnuts. The palate is already a noticeable dryness and a slight bitterness. With the addition of a few drops of water, the malt is a little more harmonious and increasingly fruity, but without noticeable loss of power.Medium to long, sweet and spicy and warm. Dark fruits, pepper, dark chocolate, nuts, Christmas spices and oak let the malt finish pleasantly long-lasting. Hidden deep in the background, I register again a soft note of sulfur. The palate is now again much drier and slightly bitter. Overall, the Glen Garioch looks older than ""only"" 15 years."
1541,Glen Garioch 15-year-old  Sherry Cask Matured,"WOW ... an awesome dram! Intense character and flavors. Despite the 53.7%, the alcohol is very well integrated and no water is needed.

In addition raisins. Does it smell that way if you stew (very) spicy trail food? The alcohol is also noticeably there. Not piercing, but noticeable. Dried plums and tart herbs. A little bit of time and warmth softens the nose, but it also gives off some sulfur. Cinnamon rolls with plum filling .... Ok, that was too long in the oven and brings cocoon flavors with it. The nose is getting better, the alcohol is barely there. Plum wrapped in bacon, sulphurous raisins - interesting.Full, fruity, slightly leathery. Tart notes of espresso will not be long in coming. The alcohol pushes on the whole and provides a full and powerful mouthfeel. Cocooned almonds. The Nachschmecken is dry and quite on the bitter side.Dry, dry and warm, the whisky stays on the palate for a long time and in the throat."
1543,Glen Garioch 15-year-old  Sherry Cask Matured,"The smell is that of a prototype of an intense sherry whisky, the sherry dominates very much. There are more and more whiskys at the moment (strange, where there are fewer and fewer sherry casks). This makes this type of whisky, unfortunately, something interchangeable, especially if, as here, so little of the Brennereicharakter remains. Nonetheless, the whisky provides a great flavor.  In the mouth, the whisky then shows more independence, but that does not make him necessarily better. I really do not like the finish.  The whisky is certainly well done, but something bothers me. Overall, he can not completely convince me. Nevertheless, he is definitely worth a recommendation. Most sherry whisky lovers will like it. The longer he breathes, the better he gets.A crystal clear sherry profile: raisins, sherry and chocolate, very classic, the alcohol is little to feel, after a while in the background follows a slightly sour note, the smell is sweeter, such as wood and some herbs, slightly grated coniferous seeds in the handThe body is rather light. This is in contrast to the sharp strong start. In the mouth, the whisky is not quite so classic. The herbs and the sour impressions take over the upper hand. A little sulfur is to taste, but that does not bother. In the second sip he gets a little sweeter. A little bitter orange is added. The sulfur gives way and gives way to dry Oloroso. With each sip he gets better. This whisky needs time.The finish again shows some sulfur and especially oak and dry sherry. Everything stays long in the mouth and throat."

1546,Glen Garioch Founder's Reserve 1797,"First impression of the nose is yeast. If you have ever stuck your head into a mash tun and inhaled the heady aroma of fermenting wort, you will get the picture. I've never experienced such a malty / yeasty nose in a whisky before, and was expecting a huge ethanol burn, but it didn't come despite the 48% ABV.The arrival on the palate is slow to begin with then BANG! Big delivery of dried fruit followed with what tastes like a handful of Fisherman's friend lozenges, with eucalyptus and liquorice on the aftertaste. Press your tongue tight against the roof of your mouth to get the full benefit of the intense spiciness that lies within.This stuff needs a splash of water and a bit of time to open up. Revisit after ten minutes, and it's a different beast altogether, malty and quite dry. Not too long on the aftertaste and leaves you with a drouth that cries out for a beer to chase it down.I bought a litre of this at the airport two months ago and I'm halfway through. A good value for money dram."
1547,Glen Garioch Founder's Reserve 1797,"A very nice whisky for a NAS. To greet the 48%.  It makes you want to discover the rest of the range; therefore successful mission.Very classic and delicious nose. Cereals.  But also oolong tea or even a slight trace of damp earth.  We feel that the maturation was done in quality barrels and that the distillate does not lack character (oily and legs around the glass, despite the youth).  After a while, a very slight hint of smoke.Fat, fruity. Not bad at all.Good length with a hint of dryness."

1550,Glen Garioch Founder's Reserve 1797,"Glen Garioch Founders Reserve, original bottling, 48% alc. Maturation: Bourbon and sherry barrels Nose: Sweet and fruity, butterscotch and lots of apples, which stay in the nose for a long time and look really ripe. In addition, malt and light citrus fruits, also an aroma of chewing gum arises. Then a light spice tone, especially pepper, is present. Palate: Clear lines and in harmony with the nose, but spicy and slightly alcoholic, also dry. Apples, juicy pears and candied ginger sticks. Very cute. This is followed by malt, vanilla and slightly burnt caramel, plus some chilli chocolate. Finish: Long and fruity, dry oak aromas. Conclusion: nose and palate work harmoniously with each other, the finish is simple. Overall a nice malt with a good price / performance ratio. However, it does not tolerate water at all! 82/100 points - notesofmalt.com"
1551,Glen Garioch Founder's Reserve 1797,More fruity and floral (and younger) than the 12. Also bottled at higher strength which is a plus. But I prefer the 12 in terms of depth and complexity for only a few bucks more.
1552,Glen Garioch Founder's Reserve 1797,"Highland fling thingI’ve never had anything from the boys at Glen Garioch, in fact I don’t think I’ve seen very much written about them over the years. Like many distilleries they just aren’t sexy enough or, more likely just don’t have the marketing shekels the big boys have to keep them in the spotlight. It’s no bad thing though, you end up spending more for the actual whisky than the advertising. Off to the highlands we go. From the get good I’m intrigued. I picked it up for about £30 and it almost doesn’t compute. Non chill filtered, sherry and bourbon casks and weighing in at a brawny 48%. This really does appear to be staggeringly good value on the surface. Is it coloured? Don’t know. Don’t care at this price and ABV. And it’s a highland. I love me a highland - to the glass, and quick!!On the nose, well first to the eye, it’s a good brassy colour. It’s looks the part. On the nose and it’s a beast. There a lot of smells clamouring to get out of the glass. Way more that I would have expected for a NAS scotch. There’s giant dollops of barley sugars sweets, malt, malt and more malt, and a sourness and honey laced porridge. Weirdly I’m getting flashbacks of Cherry Tunes. You know the smell, fruity, sour, sweet and menthol all in one. This mish-mash of bourbon and sherry and red liquorice and wood is good. Getting the nose deep in the glass and there’s more liquorice and dried fruits. It’s like Ardmore and Deanston had a one night stand watched on from the sidelines by a curios bottle of sherry. Filthy buggers. I like it. It’s a little hot to be sure, a bit gingery sweet and sour and the alcohol is clearly there but it’s not unwelcome. Good, good, good. In the mouth. I’m actually looking forward to seeing what this cheap bottle is all about. BOOOOOOM! Well, that wasn’t subtle. Everything happens very quickly. It’s a little explosive and then the explosion gets hotter. Slowing it all down and here’s what I’m getting. First it’s cool and sweet and then the sweetness builds quickly, really quickly. Tonnes of barley sugars and crystallised ginger and bourbon and vanilla landslide across the palate like a sweet shop exploding followed with heat like a confectionary fireball. Peppery, oak, more bourbon sweetness, hot sawn wood. Nice oak going on. It’s goes on with heat and ginger and peppery almost rye like prickles. I’m 2 fair sized drams in and it still feels like a firework going off in my mouth. Holding a sip in and the intensity of the flavours is huge on the palate, richness and heat and spruce and sweetness. It’s hot to be sure but it’s also packed with flavours. Nom nom nom. HmmmmSniffing the empty glass and there’s a wee bit of sulphur, memories of sherry, a little sourness. I like it.So how do you rate something like this? If it was from a bigger name it would have a legion of followers saying how good it was. If it had and age statement and was a tad more rounded it would be truly amazing. It’s rough and ready in the same way an over enthusiastic dog can be. With training it would easier to handle - less leaping all over the place but it’s ok that’s it’s a little bit, er feral.I’m actually impressed. This is never going to win any beauty pageants, it’s as unfashionable as you can get in the current climate of special cask finishes and exorbitant priced special editions, AI designed bottles that have been to space. This is workaday scotch and it’s better for it. Like a few other distilleries making scotch to really drink it will be overlooked, under appreciated and for those that like to drink decent scotch, thankfully underpriced. Long may it continue.Yumsk.Ps. Right at the end as it’s wandering away I get old coffee grounds. Nice."

1566,Glen Grant 12-year-old,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deMy first impression is of a fruity-sweet freshness, which is gradually joined by spicy oak notes. The focus is clearly focused on the bright, refreshing fruit flavors. Freshly sliced ​​green apples, which are not yet ripe and tart with an acidic impact, followed by pears, green grapes, citrus notes, juicy grapefruit, vanilla, hints of blossom honey and peppermint and spicy notes of wood. The alcohol content of 43% is barely noticeable. Uncomplicated, harmonious and pleasant.With a silky soft texture, the 12-year-old Glen Grant dresses pleasantly in the mouth. A beautiful symbiosis of refreshing sweet fruits and spicy wood notes floods the palate. The mouthfeel dries slightly after a few seconds. Freshly squeezed lemons and orange peel give the malt a slightly sourish sting. Green apples, vanilla, honey, hints of almonds, a bit of malt and spicy oak oak notes follow. Again, the overall aromatic picture is consistent: sweet-sour, fresh and tasty - simply uncomplicated and delicious.Medium long and sweet and spicy. At the finish line, a fine sweetness builds up again. Again, I find the freshly cut apples, honey, malt and vanilla again. Finally, the spicy oak notes intensify and leave a slight dryness and delicate bitterness on the palate."
1567,Glen Grant 12-year-old,"Very clear, fresh and fruity. Of course a little less intense and more effective than the 18-year-old; but the value for money is outstanding. As good as this twelve-year-old Glen Grant are not many twelve-year-olds.A fragrant fruit basket with grapes, apples (Kronprinz, Chloräpfel, Topaz), pears and a few vanilla pods. Very nice, so to speak, the boyish edition of the still young 18-year-old Grant.The malt conquers the oral cavity with a pleasant freshness. The juicy sweetness of pale fruits continues on the palate, complemented by delicate honey notes and a beautiful oak aroma.A very fine maximum medium-length finish, which turns from the fruitiness towards oak."

1569,Glen Grant 12-year-old,"Glen Grant, 12 years old, 43% alc.- Version around 2016 Nose: Fruity and grassy, some hay meadow in summer, fresh, crisp apples, juicy peaches and some vanilla. Very flattering, very fresh. After a while there is quite a note of sea salt, but only minimally. Palate: nuts, roasted almonds and a thick sweetness. Vanilla biscuits, again a lot of peach and a pleasant variety of pastries. The crunchy apples are also very sweet again. Finish: Medium-long with a hint of oak spice and mild bitterness. Initially creamy, the finish gradually becomes drier. Conclusion: A wonderful standard bottling, dominated by the influence of fresh bourbon barrels.

1571,Glen Grant 12-year-old,"A pleasant surprise; I hadn't expected much. Yes, it's unsurprisingly fruity and fresh, but halfway through, the good quality of the ex-bourbon wood used here really shines through, as things get deeper, creamier, chewier, and sweeter. The strong point, however, is the finish. Beautifully balanced, with coffee and assorted roast aromas doing an immaculate little dance on the back of the palate. Really good value for money."

1578,Glen Grant 18-year-old,"[First impression] Second impression: Quite nice malt with relaxed Ex-Bc grades. Unfortunately also a bit softened with the 43%. Do I have to try it in comparison against the 15er. Could definitely be a top summer whisky. I doubt that it goes well with a cigar, but I will try it too.Overall quite light and fresh with vanilla, citrus fruits and malted barley. The barrel flavor gives the whole thing a little grip, like ginger. Later it becomes thicker in smell and is reminiscent of field honey.Oops. Quite a thin start. In terms of taste, however, a continuation of the smell. The barrel wort becomes dominant at the back, but without becoming bitter.The finish is then amazingly handy again. Barrel wort, honey, quite floral, Nashi pear. So it sounds nice from spicy to sweet. Minimally bitter. Or rather sour?"

Admittedly a very good buy for the 1 liter bottle at below 90 EUR albeit the new version for 100+ EUR @ 0,7 liter seems a bit too steep for me. Buy as long as the liter is still available.

1593,Glen Keith 1983,"[October, 2019] A quick review of a sample......of a whisky the world does not need and I do not appreciate. This is a boring and unimpressive dram with flaws both neat (too much bitter tannins) and reduced (soapy). A good example that there are bad older releases too (of course, there are many)...The colour is yellow gold and the nose offers a simple grassy-spicy profile without off-notes but without anything of interest either. What else? After significant breathing time the barley sugars pop up, wow!The taste is sugary sweet with bitter wooden notes and some grassy-leafy flavours. That is what I call unimpressive and boring. Why should I drink such alcohol, just to get drunk? No.The dram arrrives a little peppery and a little coating on the palate. The finish is short and adds nothing except a drying feeling (tannins again). Water releases waxy notes in the nose and turns the taste soapy, arrggh!!! The rest of the sample went down the drain..."
1594,Glen Keith 1983,"The first thing that stands out is the smell of dry hay lying on the grass, after a summer storm in the nose ... Awesome. Followed by a lot of fruitiness. Welcome to the Speyside.  Departure shows subtle vanilla and some bitterness of. Short to medium.  Otherwise, a malt younger old. It is stated that it was more like 10 years in the barrels. This explains the fruitiness of the basic distillate and less the tart, vanilla and caramel notes.  One paints from the mid-80s of the last century, which is no better and worse than a young malt from the present day, just different. This can be clearly stated. Everyone is better off now, everyone has to weigh for themselves. However, it is always interesting that you can still get to such bottlings to get a picture of the times and thus can expand the whisky horizon."
1595,Glen Keith 1983,"On first nosing it smells fresh, fruity and creamy there are various fruits in the mix and I think I detect a bit of tinned peached in syrup but in truth I have a cold so the snoz is not functioning too well at the moment.The palate is really spirity and a little rough with very little balance on show. at first anyway but it does improve with time in the glass and some nice fruit notes emerge,The finish is a little drying but ok.I think that if this had a couple more years in the casks the rough edges may disappear tastes younger than its stated 10 years but a step above my 75 points MOTR score so an average of 80-82 points I feel is right for this one."

Simple and sweet broad mouthful and mouthfeel with floral/fruity/malty notes developing but becoming astringent and drying with only a mild malt and oak presence.F: Floats effortlessly into the ether carrying with it the remnants of light malt, dried flowers and apple spirit with boozy hot chocolate and a freshening and earthy after glow.C: A bit too spirit led overall but there are glimmers of hope throughout, especially on the nose with some interesting finishing characteristics too. Well worth picking up a miniature for £3.Scores a C"
1599,Glen Keith 1983,This is a beautifully balanced malt. I wish I had a lot of it.Classy. I've had some rough Glen Keith and some lovely stuff and the nose on this indicates the latter.

1603,Glen Keith 1995  Chivas Brothers - Cask Strength Edition,
1604,Glen Keith 1995  Chivas Brothers - Cask Strength Edition,"Nose: Immediately fruity, a mix of ripe citrus notes, apricots and plums. Pretty closed and not very complex at first. So put some water in it! It opens quickly, has lots of coconut, marzipan, actually reminds me of the fruitiness that I find in a simple Ruby port. The longer the water is in my dram, the more wiry and mineral it becomes, losing something of its creamy sweet appearance.  Mouth: Strong, despite the water with alcoholic touch, but rather slim and not as sweet, as expected. The fruit is now in the background, but I have a lot of floral, honey, even with some soil and amazing herbal tonicity. Again some marzipan, light nuttiness, fine elegance.  Finish: Long, herbal-toned, but with some vanilla and minerality.  Conclusion: I have to say that at first glance I expected more from this whisky, and I especially missed the sweet fruitiness on the palate, which is more common in earlier Glen Keith vintages. Yet, this malt has wonderful qualities that remain a little hidden when approached too quickly and hastily. If you give it time in the glass and a few drops of water, then it shows a very elegant and fine malt.  https://whiskycuse.wordpress.com/"

1620,Glen Keith 1998  The Distillery Reserve Collection,"[July, 2018]  A quick review of a sample.The colour is pale straw and the texture shows small tears with medium fast legs.  The nose is very fresh on a home-grown fruits profile that reminds me a little of Bladnoch (green apple skins).  After some time of breathing more sugary and malty aromas shine through but all in all it is not overly complex.  It arrives hot and peppery on the palate with a minor coating effect.  The taste is barley sugary sweet with some fruits and rather shy spices from the wood.  The finish is short and adds no new impressions.  Water turns the dram even sweeter but does not release major new aromas or flavours - so if you like sweeter whiskies reduce it, otherwise enjoy it neat.This is a typical modern-style whisky from rather sub-standard casks that did not support the spirit's maturation very well.  It is easy drinkable but that's it, usually Glen Keith can offer much more than what is shown by this release..."

1652,Glen Keith Distillery Edition,"Thanks to karloff for the sample.It's a 40% NAS, but at least it's uncoloured and unfiltered.I usually don't concider to buy bottles I rate below 80, but if I find this at £25 I would happily make an exception.Light, fresh and fruity.Sweet citrus, pear, iced tea.Cereal base.Quite vegetal/green.Noticable burst of spice, but it doesn't overpower anything else.Right after swallowing I get a hint of some scented detergent or air freshener that I can't name.That iced tea note returns.Very short, but refreshing."
1653,Glen Keith Distillery Edition,"I have to agree with tomjcollins85. For the price and as far as Nas go this isn't bad at all. I've had a lot worse that cost a lot more.Orange peel, honey nut cornflakes, lemon grass, green grapes, wet pile of logs, stewed vegetables and apple pie crust sprinkled with sugar.Nothing special about this but nothing wrong with it either. A no brainer shall we say. Something to sip and not think about too much. It hits a note and stays there. Fruit, honey and grassy flavours.The finish is short but not bad. Sugar and spice on the death."
1654,Glen Moray 10-year-old  Fired Oak,"Life is too short to dwell on this bottleDry, fruit hidden behind. Occasionally, alcohol sticks out.Watery, a little bit of cookie dough, a little sweet.Sweet malt, has a scented effect."
1655,Glen Moray 10-year-old  Fired Oak,"I'm quite a fan of Glen Moray, nice and soft, and the Chardonnay Cask Finish is really sublime because the Chardonnay barrel really adds something.  I miss that quite a bit with this Fire Oak.  I had hoped to smell and taste some more jack-daniel-like charcoal notes, but I miss this completely in this whisky, and wonder what the addition of the term 'fired oak' is.  Perhaps the whisky should have been in this flared barrel for much longer.  All in all a great whisky to drink, but don't be fooled by the title."

1661,Glen Moray 10-year-old  Fired Oak,"It's good but this won't set your world on fire.A hit of vanilla but also spring leaves, fruity beer and candied bananas. It's slightly floral and there's a touch lemon syrup as well. Finally a whiff of raw oak.The banana and vanilla make an encore but is accompanied by soft spices, like cinnamon. A few tart berries make an appearance as well. The influence of the virgin oak is under control and not too dominant; only a whiff of sawdust.Quite dry and pretty spicy. Little too much wood here."
1662,Glen Moray 10-year-old  Fired Oak,"Aroma: delicate, light floral and honey sweetness, crumb of gray bread, freshly cut grass, hay, vanilla, wood shavings, zest. Over time, notes of sweet vanilla pastries, meringues, shades of sweet lemonade are revealed.  Taste: sweet, quite saturated, caramel, various spices - ginger, cinnamon, cloves, herbal medicinal tea, bitter zest, woody motifs.  Finish: medium-long, albeit lightweight, a lot of wood, grassy motifs, zest, at the very end there is a clear impression that just chewed a piece of bitter zest with sugar.  Rating: 79  Bottom line: a good initial option, youth is not noticeable, the influence of fresh oak is moderate, without an obsessive unpleasant oak, but at the same time, a fresh barrel makes it a little unusual, more spicy in comparison with peers from Speyside."

1669,Glen Moray 12-year-old  Elgin Heritage,"The Glen Moray Distillery was originally an Elgin West Brewery, which opened in 1830, producing local ales. Preserved handwritten books indicate that the first distillation process was carried out on September 13, 1897, using local barley. From the beginning, barrels have been used not only after American bourbon but also after Chardonnay, sherry and port wine, which was an extremely rare practice at that time. It is a tradition that continues to this day - whisky matures in on-site warehouses.WhiskyLovingPianist scored this whisky on 80 points with comment which I liked: This is May's straight bourbon house styleSpices, vanilla, caramel, shy berry, OakSweet, notes of vanilla and caramel, OakOak, Caramel"

No special depth but if you like the character of Glen Moray a great nose.  Taste: light (only 40% thin) and creamy with some youthful alcoholic tinges, honey, crushed apricots, some caramel and malt and then backwards and on the finish dry sweetness, spicy honey, earthy aromas and bitter oak ( old wood). The finish is woody and earthy with medium length. Oh yes you have to like it - because you realize the use of multiple used barrels but bad that is not now but it just can not keep up with the nose.  Conclusion: nice entry into the Glen Moray Range which brings the character of the distillery quite well. The twist in the finish could be a bit daunting for beginners."

Toffee, gentle sweetness.Very brief appearance ... then he's gone again. Where are the barrels. Worse still ... what barrels? I don't think that's bad at all for dinner. Ahaa .... several sips then he wakes up. Hola.There isn't really an exit. Because he is suddenly gone again during the tasting. It's already in the middle of the finish when swallowing it.

I won't buy a second bottle. The sample is enough for me. But good craft.It starts with a subtle hint of smoke. The bourbon barrels are not dominant. Well done. And yet there is enough vanilla with peppery oak. The alcohol holds back wonderfully. Good start.Peppery spice in the mouth with a filling malt taste. Distillery character with balanced vanilla, flavored with the choice of barrel. Very well chosen. Also no bitterness from the oak. The pleasant sweetness slowly passes into drying wood. Too bad.Medium to long and soft with sweet oak. But unfortunately a bit withdrawn in the experience. He walks without attracting attention. That's it, too bad. But, ... Conclusion: If this price remains below 70 €, the PLV is completely ok for me. Good bottle."

Also on the tongue with lots of chocolate, nougat and marzipan, less floral than on the nose. Caramel, toffee, coffee beans, coffee with milk.Rather short, dry and chocolaty."
1687,Glen Moray 18-year-old  Elgin Heritage,"Was really looking forward to this as I consider Glen Moray wildly underappreciated as a distillate. [Also, the Chardonnay-cask-matured 10-year-old at ca. 25 € and the old 16-year-old at ca. 30 € were some of the best value-for-money whiskies you could get, even at 40%.] So an eighteen-year-old, unchillfiltered and with a higher ABV? Sign me up!However, this is one of those cases were the more expensive eighteen-year-old comes across lighter and less impressive than its younger counterparts (see also: the recent Glen Scotia at 15 and 18 years of age). This is all fruit, florals, and malt, with a very, very reserved wood influence. Super light on the nose and a tad bitter on the tongue. All things considered, it's just a bit underwhelming for its age and price bracket. On the nose: dusty grains, icing sugar, hay, and daisies. On the palate: initially sweet (honey) and juicy (apple compote), then a sense of barrel char introduces a turn to tartness. Finish: ends on bitter and sour notes, with some astringency. I could've gotten behind this concept of the 18 as a lighter, more delicate proposal, but the sour-bitter finish disqualifies it for me. Good as an apéritif, maybe, but not as a standalone affair."

1704,Glen Moray Elgin Classic  Chardonnay Cask Finish,"I sometimes wonder what people expect when they buy a single malt for under 20 €. Of course this is not mature, sophisticatedly complex or whatever ... this is a NAS that was probably exactly 28 months in reffill barrels and then finished for 8 months in cheap Chardonnay barrels.

1706,Glen Moray Elgin Classic  Chardonnay Cask Finish,"Pours a fairly light pale yellow. Scent is fairly mild. not recognizable straight up as wine to me, let alone specifically chardonnay, but the oak character is toned down, the sharpness of the whisky is tampered. On the other hand, the whisky does have aroma, the oak is present but just more 'deep' rather than agressive. Very welcoming. The taste has some oak, but again, more of a creamy, widespread character than sharp and rough. Wine gives some aroma's here as well, not recognizable as wine, but the pieces do fit in the palate. Some fruityness, making this whisky different to others. Hides the alcohol fairly well. Very entry level, easy going whisky. Nice enough, for sure."

How would you successfully construct a good malt with Chardonnay finish (which I did not really find...) for about 23 EUR? Simple answer: You don't. Not bad but totally pointless and forgettable.

Fresh but friendly, a bit mowed grass, a bit vanilla. Actually an average speyside whisky smell with a touch of wine.I can taste the chardonnay pretty well, a fresh but also very smooth whisky.

1733,Glen Moray Elgin Classic  Sherry Cask Finish,"Pours a medium to medium light pale yellow. Scent is less expressive than the chardonnay. upon a swirl, a blast of oxidative features rise up. Nuttyness, remenicing of an Oloroso, it seems. Taste is rather sweet, fairly mild on the experience. Mild oxidative notes from the sherry, but not as outspoken as I'd like it. Mild oaky finish. Easy going whisky - nothing bad about it, just not very specific. Bourbon is still a bit recognizable, due to higher vanilla levels compared to the chardonnay version. Hard to pick a favorite between the 2 - this is more my tooth, but I 'respect' the chardonnay more due to it's uniqueness and smoother blend between barrel and whisky."

No odd off-notes, no conflicting flavors, but no personality either.Apple juice, a wisp of peat, and caramel. An undertone of dirty laundry, and assorted Haribo candy. It's really quite sweet and simple. Is there 1st fill bourbon here? Doughiness.Initially sweet and big, but completely hollow inside. There is an obvious youth to it, that in fact isn't that far off from the 3yo offerings of various new distilleries, except instead of being a bearded hipster with obscure hobbies, this one's as buttoned up as they come. A traditional low middle tier Spey, kissed by the most generic bourbon cask. Sure there could be more to it, but the mix is uninspiring, and the wet dough notes betray its young average age.Sweet, faintly acetonic. Nothing to speak of."

You can tell the years in the bottle, the aromas are slightly dusty and have also got a hint of old bottle flavor, malt coffee, some wet corrugated cardboard. After the first sip, a lot of resin, a little hawthorn blossom.  Mouth: Does not necessarily taste like 40%, but mainly after an old bottle. A lot of malt, some polished wood, then block malt afterwards, charred toasted bread, some fir honey. Burnt plastic, grape jelly.  Finish: Amazingly long, resinous, block malt and long drawn green tea.  Comment: I don't think it's bad, but it mostly lives from the old bottle flavor. Which means you can get everything from Ottonormalmalt to a layered bottle for 120 € (?, I don't know the actual auction price). My suggestion: take Glencadam 13 and leave it open for 2 days, then it probably tastes just as old school and has more percentages.

Some wood shavings and freshly cut grass. For a second it reminds me a bit of a young Irish whisky. Pleasant, but nothing special.The malt is a touch creamy with immediately a sweet and sour mix of caramel, oranges and peach and some quinine. The green grass lingers. From the second sip forward it becomes a tad sweeter and the bitterness slowly fades.The medium long finish offers up a peppery note and the return of oranges.In all honesty, this is a very common dram, even a touch boring."

In my old rating system (ten scales that translate into WB points: 50 - 66 - 75 - 80 - 82,5 - 85 - 87,5 - 90 - 92,5 - 95) I scored this 82,5.  My notes state a golden colour and a rather light texture.  The nose is on a massive honey sweetness with some fruity aromas (rockmelon, hints of banana).  It must have been a batch that contained both sherry and bourbon casks as there a some sherry notes as well as vanilla.  The mouthfeel is a little stronger than the nose and well rounded.  The taste is a little less sweet than expected from the nose.  Some toasting flavours make it slightly bitter (roasted coffee, charcoal).  With water added it gets more alcoholic and the toasting flavours grow stronger.  The finish is of medium length.This was bottled between 1983 and 1987."

This very rare whisky was bottled to celebrate… well, it’s all in the name, isn’t it. It’s a 75cl bottle, so probably one of the very last whiskies that have been bottled in that capacity. Colour: pale gold. They did not choose some heavy sherry! Nose: I’d have never thought such a high-octane monster would be so elegant, so refined, and even so reserved. A little barley sugar, tinned peaches and pears, some light tea (what my dear wife drinks, English Breakfast tea), a touch of nectar and pollen – not quite honey – and then drops of menthol essence on a handkerchief. Like in Proust. Elegant indeed. With water: not many changes, which is a little disappointing. Mouth (neat): totally in the style of the very sadly missed Rare Malts, the best and the greatest series any distillers have ever done. That is to say a little challenging and philosophical at times, probably a little brutal as well, but so highly complex that you immediately think you’ll need at least one hour to properly assess it. Which we’ll do another time. Barley sugar, tinned fruits, beeswax, pollen, ripe apples. Forgot to mention honeysuckle syrup and liquorice. Funnily enough, it’s got the texture of Lagavulin, just not the peat. With water: once again, no real changes. Barley syrup. Finish: medium, fruity, perhaps a little minimal? Too intellectual for me?

It even has a sour edge that needs some time to evaporate. Ratherfarmy, which was unexpected and in all honesty not very nice in this case. Onlyafter about five minutes does it turn sweet as chocolate with praline filling.The attack is feisty,but not scorching. That is good. On the palate, it is bulls eye from the getgo.

1796,Glen Ord 1974  Rare Malts Selection,"[November, 2019] I had this dram during a FoSM club tasting......and this is a fine old-style whisky that is best enjoyed neat with all its 60.8% abv. It takes quite some time to unlock all the secrets of this dram but it is an interesting hide-and-seek challenge. Not suited when you are in an enjoyment mode only and not willing to invest some exploration efforts...The colour is pale gold and the nose is punchy first due to the high abv. After my olfactory cells adapted to this a fruity (trademark Glen Ord) and malty profile appears which enfolds nicely upon breathing. There are lots of additional aromas to detect over time, among them coffee, oily, waxy and autumn floral impressions. This is a very old-stylish nose - complex and full of surprises but no easy-to-identify aromas. It requires both patience and time to unlock its secrets but it is worth the effort.The taste is very fruity (exotic fruits mainly) and honey-sweet with a lot of other flavours join in over time. It is not really layered but very chewable and I suggest to do so for some time. Nice spices are released (peppers, cloves, mint and more), a tasty bitter tea-ish note and even an impression that reminds me of old cognac. Not too bad!The dram arrives hot and coating on the palate with some peppery moments. The finish is of medium length and adds more barley sugars which turn it rather simple and less interesting than the taste. Some water makes the nose even more punchy and smoothes / sweetens the taste but the interesting flavour components are (almost) gone now. More water releases waxy-earthy aromas in the nose but flattens the taste - I like the power and profile of the neat dram best."

But mostly – and this does not sound good, but can be truly magnificent in a whisky – rotting oranges. And some soft woodsmoke. Lovely nose that can easily entertain you for more than fifteen minutes.Ka-boom! Very powerful arrival – which is no surprise, of course – with a very waxy note. Lots of menthol, quinine, dried aprictos, mandarin, strawberry again, candy cherries and coconut. Earl Grey tea (which is kinda funny after the coffee on the nose).

All in all an old Speysider without frills. 88 points."

Nose: we’re rather closer to the MoS than to the SigV but this one is drier than both and a bit more plankish – not that there’s anything excessive here. More sawdust on top of some apple juice and even cider. Quite some coffee, chicory and green tea and then the same kind of waxiness as in the others. The most austere so far. With water: almost the same as the MoS. Mouth (neat): extremely close to the MoS, it’s almost the same whisky in fact. Maybe just a little less of everything from the oak and a little more fresh fruits, especially kiwis and maybe rhubarb (something acidic). Now the dried ginger’s big! With water: modern sweetness from American oak. Finish: long, with the same notes. Comments: the MoS was going to eleven as far as American oak’s concerned, this one goes to ten. I see no reason to score it differently, though. SGP:552 - 85 points."
1808,Glen Ord 25-year-old  Diageo Special Releases 2004,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2020/06/30/old-rare-2020-four-glens-part-1-2/What better demonstrates the appeal of TWE Old & Rare Show than a 25yo 1970s vintage Glen Ord for just £5? Headed by Colin Dunn, Diageo’s J&B had plenty of affordable gems on offer.This Diageo-owned highland distillery is one of the very large distilleries producing 11 million+ litres of spirit a year from two mash tuns that hold 12.6 tonnes of mash and 22 Douglas Fir washbacks that hold 59000 litres each. I’m told their [medium-length] 75-hour fermentation helps promote light fruity esters. Ord produces slightly more sherry-matured whisky [by volume] than bourbon. Their on-site warehouses store around 12,600 casks with around half of their annual spirit output tankered away and filled into casks in Stirling – so you could argue that only of half of Glen Ord’s spirit truly becomes Glen Ord single malt, whilst the rest matures as Stirling Scotch.N: This initially appears as soft as the Glen Mhor, but with significant abv differentials, it’ll no doubt grow and grow – and grow it does with juicy fruits [apricot & strawberry jam], fruit tea, and some rich fruit soft confectionary, the woodiness becoming more apparent as it opens up. What’s amazing, given the stats, is how fresh and vibrant this Ord is. Despite being distilled just eight years after the Glen Mhor, this appears far more lively and contemporary. Is that just the abv or was there also an active cask finish here? Blowing away the ethanol top reveals more earthy & dry plant [scorch-dried cowslip] notes before the sweeter yellow vanilla-ey fruits move in then towards tropical citrus and a wonderful musty malty depth.T&F: Being of beautifully aged bourbon-like malty savoury < sweet citrus on the palate, this one’s development is big and peppery [asking for a little water], but hold it in the mouth either way for a spectacular honeyed mildly-sweet malty citrus mouthfeel and development into a long-long finish. With a little water, you have an exemplary Highland malt, one that glides and glides. No need to overcomplicate things here. That’s one delicious delivery. I resisted [until now], mentioning a fair likeness to a [for now] long-closed distillery further North just off the A9, but I find there to be plenty of similarities.C: Same score as the Glen Mhor, for different reasons, this represents 25-year-old whisky just as well as the previous dram but in a totally different way. Both prove there is no other way we know of, of arriving at these sorts of junctures without a long waiting game."
1809,Glen Ord 25-year-old  Diageo Special Releases 2004,"Color: Chestnut / Oloroso Sherry.  Nose: nail polish remover. Vanilla, freshly cut grass, old, slightly musty hay.

It's full-bodied and medium (barley) sweet. One the one side it's thick and creamy on buns from the oven and vanilla custard, on the other side it's a tad drying from the oak, with (next to the pepper) ginger. A drop of water helps to integrate everything. It gives some additional earthy notes of gentian, plus peach and melon.Rather long, but too much dominated by wood influence if you ask me.

1818,Glen Ord 28-year-old  Diageo Special Releases 2003,"[September, 2018] It is always a little tricky which dram you select first after you arrived in Scotland because there are so many expectations and pleasant anticipations that even an excellent dram can easily loose against these. Or a rather average dram gets completely over-rated due to the great setting your are in when enjoying it. This year I selected this 28-years old Glen Ord at the bar of the famous Craigellachie hotel because I had the 30-years old Glen Ord several years ago and it was a perfect choice…...and this is a good one either! It is not as good as the 30-years old (WB id 3030 that I scored flabbergasting 93 points) but still it is a great dram. The fruits are not as lush as with the 30y but still fine and enjoyable and there is a surprisingly salty touch with the neat dram. Water is essential on this release and good for a 2-3 points difference in my score (I always score what I like best - either the neat or reduced dram). Funnily, this whisky reminds me in a lot of aspects of a 28-years old Pulteney (WB id 22392) that I had just recently...The nose is a little punchy first but after your olfactory cells adapted to that a fine and balanced profile of malty and fruity aromas shows up with lots of salty notes and other spices. After adding some water the punchiness is completely gone but the salty touch too, unfortunately...The palate is much more fruity than the nose with fine barley sugars and honeys added. Later the spices and herbs join in but the taste is less salty than the nose (but still the salt is clearly detectable - given it is not there at all. Scientists never ever found any salt NaCl in any whisky they analysed.). Some water turns the taste smoother and more balanced - I like it much more when it is somewhat reduced.The initial mouthfeel is warming and (just) a little coating with minor peppery moments. The finish is rather long and more sugary with no bitter or astringent feelings. It is nicely chewable and again it profits from a reduced abv. Water is essential on this dram, actually."

Cake.The taste is sweet - a mouthful of candy from an iron box. The sweetness continues and goes into fresh apples, then into Apple jam. Added a bit of water . Whisky doesn't burn in your mouth at all. There is no aggression, on the contrary, it feels soft and pleasant fruit compote. I don't even want to swallow it, it's such a nice drink.The aftertaste is bright and sweet. There is a bit of wormwood bitterness, but it then recedes to sweetness. With water, the aftertaste became even sweeter. Fantastic!"

A malt of 28 years in my eyes, or better in the throat not so burn '.  Opinions differ, both in cars, in women, and in whisky. This whisky is not mine. He has a decent oak load, which I do not dislike, even if it is on the palate already very 'bitter', but in the end, the whole package is still too sharp (even throttled to about 50% vol). That's why, only '87 points, which is not bad per se. At the price, I expect a palate party."

Papaya jelly, light smoke, cantaloupe-flavored e-cigarette, pineapple acid, slightly grassy, fresh sea water, waxy texture. If you think about it carefully, the waxy texture flies with the pineapple, who is it like? The faint pear, slightly fleshy, wakes up after a while, with the sweetness of orange juice. The aroma is a tame and comfortable bourbon barrel style. I think it is close to this kind of ceiling level. I personally think it is significantly better than the Brora 1977 RMS 24yo 56.1%. Taste: The smoky feeling is not obvious in the mouthfeel. The scratching feeling of barley sugar and grass starts to get better, followed by sugared lemon juice, Spanish olives, passion fruit, pear juice, immature dried bamboo shoots, dark chocolate , The blend of grease. The bitterness of grapefruit peel is outstanding. The wine is strong, medium fat, dry, thick but not completely filled with flavor, slightly white. The overall style is palatable, slightly irritating, slightly tannin, not astringent or bitter. p85-b90 Aftertaste: shredded ginger, grapefruit peel, slightly astringent, no bitter bottom, slightly mint. General comment: scbp-4471, the aroma and flavor are biased towards the fruit camp of papaya and cantaloupe, pleasing and comfortable. The taste is not what I like, the green grass is slightly strong, the wine is full-bodied but has a flavorful white space, it would be better if it gives a half black and half citrus bitter taste while giving more other flavors to balance.

With too much water, a note of sweet candyfloss appears.Bitter, nippy (but who would expect otherwise, at 66.2% abv), oak, spice, some cream and fruit hiding in the background. Malty, somewhat citric and leafy. Old cheese. Poor balance; the spice, cereal, bitterness, and kind of earthy peat, hide the fruit and other sweet notes.Not as hot as the nose led me to expect. Better balance here - the cream and fruit are allowed to be seen.A dry, cereal maltiness. Some bitter moments, but not terribly distracting.

The ""greedy"" Oban special release was simply sub-standard with an awful aftertaste so what will the ""greedy"" Glen Ord special release be all about?...and it is quite below average too! The nose is nice with fruity, honey and malty aromas but the whisky falls apart as soon as the dram reaches my taste buds. The spirit flavours and the wooden flavours fight each other what provides an unbalanced and unpleasant profile to my palate. But both the mouthfeel and finish are even much worse: bitter, drying and very astringent (the tannins attack every single taste bud very aggressively) - obviously they used a high share of virgin oak casks for this release. Actually, I do not think this is malt whisky - this is a sub-standard Bourbon at best (to all the Bourbon drinkers: Most bourbon whiskies are way better - and cheaper - than this). For lovers of extreme bitter and astringent wooden notes, only…What the hell is Diageo doing - are these really the best casks in their warehouses nowadays? Or do they think today's malt whisky customers drink any stuff anyhow regardless of the quality (and pay 100 pounds just because it is called a ""special release"")?

This may be, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't produce good whisky. The profile may be safe (it's quite malty) and this expression is no exception.

I think it deserves more.Colour: light copperThe nose is honest, which may not sound very sexy, but I mean it and I think it's good. The malty distillery profile comes out well here. It's like smelling barley, husks, and some chalk. Then there is dough and pastry, vanilla, cinnamon, green apple, gooseberry and mint.Rounded but not too sweet, and moderately spicy. The malty profile continues with honeyed cereal, freshly baked croissants, green kiwi, vanilla, cinnamon and ginger. Still a bit chalkyModerate and increasingly spicy, though very gently.

1893,The Singleton of Glen Ord 18-year-old  Diageo Special Releases 2019,"[November, 2019] Just two rather low rates so far without any word written - Glen Ord is known for fine fruity malts, so did Diageo select bad casks for its special release or were they just not to the liking of these two members (which is okay because there is no accounting for taste)? I have to check this by myself, certainly......and I like it much better, actually very much better. This is a dram that somehow combines the best from both old-style and modern-style profiles, maybe a transitional dram? I enjoy to explore it and I enjoy to quaff it both neat and reduced at several levels (a characteristic of a great dram, no doubt). And the mouthfeel is simply adorable (and hard to find in modern whiskies, unfortunately)...[April, 2020] I re-tasted this dram tonight and confirm my old rating - maybe I am a little less enthusiastic but I find this a very tasty and interesting dram again. Tonight I go for 89 points on all dimensions but to be honest - this makes no difference. Still I like to quaff this dram very much...[November, 2021] Another re-taste and again I confirm my old review and score. This is one of the better Diageo special releases and still I recommend to savour it a little reduced (after a detailed exploration of the neat dram).The colour is old gold and the nose offers a modern malt profile that is pretty fine. The fruity-honeyed aromas are in good balance with the spices and tannins of the wood without any off-note. After some breathing fine waxy, floral and oily notes join in - hey, now this nose gets very interesting! Let it breathe for at least ten minutes and take a sniff every minute or so because the nosing profile changes quite a lot over this time. It starts with a modern fruity-honeyed-wooden style and ends up with old-style waxy-oily-earthy aromas - and I like both. Later the wooden notes grow stronger again but never dominate.The taste is nicely layered and starts surprisingly with delicious spices before the sweeter fruits and honeys join in (usually it is the other way around). Next are waxes and barley sugars followed by earthy and liquorice impressions. All delicious, without any flaw and in a fine balance. Water releases delicious toffee-buttery aromas in the nose and turns the taste fruitier hence even more quaffable. I like to explore this dram neat, drink some neat sips and then I reduce it to about 46% abv.The dram arrives warming and without distracting moments on the palate and instantly covers the whole of the mouth with a creamy texture. Wow, what a great mouthfeel! The finish is long and strengthens the spicy and toffee side of the dram. There is a minor cardboardy moment towards the end but this is not really distracting (nonetheless unwanted and it prevents this dimension from crossing the 90 points barrier too)."

It needs a bit of time, but is well worth the wait. Some nougat and a hint of cocoa. In the far back I even get some cola! A hint of oak kicks in. It turns a bit waxy.

The time in the barrel shows. Not the most complex 18 y.o. out there, but a great example of what the distillery has to offer. Rich oak and dried fruits (dates, raisins, cherries, and apricots), a touch of salted dried meat, mixed baking spices, a soft floral note and mixed cereal grains, fresh fruits (mangoes, pineapple, and globe grapes), a touch of vanilla and honey, and a fading whiff of barrel char and sweet sherry. Light dried fruits and mixed cereal grains, barrel char and leather, toasted vanilla creme brulee, mixed nuts, and fresh fruits. Soft oak and floral honey, soft ginger spice, baking spices, and fresh green fruits."

1908,The Singleton of Glen Ord 18-year-old,"In smell, it looks very much like the 12yo, somewhat fuller still.  In the body, this 18-year-old is the least 'hit' by the low Abv (compared to the 12 and 15yo), very smooth and soft, but also lacks character. Here too a missed opportunity, too bad.  This core-range does have potency in the fragrance, had it only been bottled at a higher Abv ...Fruity, orange, apricot. And sweet, honey, vanilla. Somewhat spicy too.Very soft and supple, honey, prunes, hint of caramel, little orange.Still very soft and supple, mid-long, some sweet, honey and maybe some orange."

1914,The Singleton of Glen Ord 38-year-old,"Rated by Serge on whiskyfunThis is the new wonder, composed by one of Diageo’s main – albeit discreet – top slingers, Mrs Maureen Robinson. It is a kind of reverse-finishing, meaning that she decided to re-rack some bourbon casks into various seasoned woods (including PX, naturally) after just 12 years, and to let that ‘finishing’ period last for 26 further years. The owners are talking about ‘finishing’ but that’s actually double-maturation, is it not? Anyway, we all remember the old ‘square’ Glen Ord 30yo, so expectations are super-high. There should be beeswax in the menu! Colour: full gold. Nose: that old 30 yo instantly springs to mind. Beeswax in abundance, old Sauternes, a few medicinal touches (camphor, embrocations), a lot of orange blossom water, earl grey, kumquats, heather honey, orange zests, a touch of plasticine, petit manseng (white wines from Jurançon), old waxed papers, ‘opening a beehive’… Well this nose is extra-ord-inary indeed (oh no, not again!) Mouth: we’re in old liqueurs territory, really. I suppose a world-class mixologist could almost replicate this for a wealthy patron. Let’s try, I would select old yellow chartreuse, triple-sec, a little pine bud liqueur, a few drops of Scandinavian tar liqueur, probably some fig arrak, and perhaps a few drops of old blue curaçao. But don’t fear, this old Ord is not blue. But shake or stir? No ideas, I’m anything but a mixologist (as you could just notice). Finish: rather long, creamy, with a little more vanilla, apricot jam, quinces, more beeswax and honeys… The pine-y and camphory notes are back in the aftertaste. Comments: very interesting because you might feel that there’s both something old and something pretty fresh in this one. A senior athlete, in other words. I find it absolutely superb.SGP:671 - 92 points."

1921,Glen Scotia 10-year-old  Unpeated,"Campbeltown entry-level class: 10 years, unpeated, 40% vol., colored and chill-filtered with a minimum alcohol content. Ok, you can try it, after all it's Glen Scotia, a distillery that has gained a good reputation in recent years - especially with the festival bottlings. In WhiskyJason's Campbeltown Blind Tasting he came in third. Uh, what? Here, too, we have to taste again ... www.glen-efze.deThe whisky starts off a little flat on the nose, which certainly also explains the weak 40% vol. is owed. But over time it develops a bit. There are fruit notes that are not only on the light fruity side, but also cherry, a little in the direction of artificial cherry aromas. For 10 years the aroma is quite ok.The taste is then also cherry, reminiscent of cough drops with cherry flavor. None of this lasts very long and is a bit weak, a little mustiness, funk or maritime aromas flashes behind the fruit, but remains more of an appeal and does not assert itself. The light cherry remains in the foreground, the whisky is sweet overall. There was a cherry sunkist in childhood long ago...The finish cannot build up, some cherry menthol remains. And a little bitterness from the undefined casks. Quite nice with the cherries - but then overall too meaningless, flat and much too sweet and perfumed. The typical Campbeltown notes are missing, the funk is hinted at and then quickly disappears. Somehow the reason why you should buy this whisky is missing. It's a bit like a wine that's too sweet, flavored with cherry lollipops. Sorry, but this isn't a Campbeltown whisky..."
1922,Glen Scotia 10-year-old  Unpeated,"Oak spice and old, sweet porridge on the nose as well as overlaid, i.e. oxidized white wine. With a couple of old apples. On the palate, initially a bit watery and bubbly, then oak spice. Slightly burnt walnut.

1929,Glen Scotia 10-year-old - Peated  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"Without having to stretch hard in the barrel at the age of 10, he makes a pretty confident appearance and gets the best out of the ex-bourbon barrel. Crystal clear Campbeltown profile, plus a good portion of smoke and a varied play of aromas from the nose to the finish. What more could you want.Fresh, clear, mildly fruity and salty - everything at the same time, everything at the beginning. Emerging sea feeling with salty spray, beach grass, rose hips, damp stone. In the distance the smoke of a campfire. A very direct nose, you can immediately find accessStarts strong and stays as fresh and refreshing as the nose more than suggested. Freshly sliced apricots, lemon juice, grapefruit meat. Hints of smoke. Creamy caramel, espresso beans. Creamy at the beginning, it becomes dry over time. The initially cautious smoky note increases in intensity, accompanied by chips of freshly cut oak logs. (Cayenne) pepper, chervil and savory. Semi-dry herbs.Lingers on the tongue for a surprisingly long time. Mineral like the colleagues from Springbank, with a pleasantly spicy smoky note, lime wedges and tart herbs."

Simply and simply great - for me a great Talisker replacement (this picks me up with its current quality just not more)creamy and fresh, vanilla, salt water, lychee juice, lots of pepper and light oak bitterness. Smoke is almost gone. Again, without much depth but absolutely intense and still tasty.Now the oak is becoming more and more dominant, lemon zest and salt, pepper and malty sweetness.

By the way: urgently with waterIt already starts colorfully at the nose: sweet fruits, sour and slightly bitter grapefruit paired with a hint of menthol, you can smell the caramel with a little toffee. Always sweet and yet spicy and bitter. A big movie theater.Hearty sweet mixed with vanilla and honey, it spreads throughout the mouth and brings you one sweet jam emerges, which then becomes a little drier and also slightly peaty in taste. An amazingly full body for this age. It is even creamy. Impressive for such a younger malt. Brilliant !Not very long, but he adds dark caramel cream and finishes with chocolate and brown sugar over butterscotch. Respect for the barrel selection. Masterpiece."
1940,Glen Scotia 15-year-old  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"Outstanding Glen Scotia. What a discovery! Between 50 and 60 EUR, depending on where you shop. This is very fair for this tipple. Recommended!OMG, what a grand nose this is! Loads of toffee and soft spices, but this nose is mostly dominated by all kinds of fruit going from Seville oranges, raisins and fresh figs to candied pineapple and dried apricots. It also has a milky side that I cannot quite define. And something dusty as if I am sitting in the attic. Lastly there is a candy-like sweetness and a touch of smoke. I really like this a lot.It is a veritable flavor bomb on the palate! Quasi-creamy and very spicy, it arrives with quite a bit of oomph. Sturdy fellow, despite its 46%. Very spicy on ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Next to all the fruit from the nose, I also get some soft honey and barley sugars and again that dusty element that makes it somewhat old school and brings a smile to my face. Yes, you can easily call this complex. From the second sip forward it also has something syrupy, reminding me of rum. The smoke joins the fray, the oak gives it a bitter touch and the circle is complete.The finish is medium long on sweet smoke with dark touches of sugar rich fruit and some cold coffee at the death."

Glen Scotia has always been a bit under the radar, but it has a lot to offer as a distillery! The 15-year-old expression has an intriguing nose, featuring salted caramel, pastries and apricots. Porridge, honey and floral scent add to the complexity. Spicy, aromatic and increasingly cask-dominated, the palate is balanced out by subtle sweetness, bitter walnuts and a touch of arugula.

Ginger, chilli, dry and well integrated oak. Behind all that fruits - creamy apricot, banana, apple, dried pars, hint of citrus. Honey, malty oat biscuits and a bit of vanilla. Hints of smoke and dunnage funk give everything complexity and earthiness. Classic Campbelltown. On the palate, mostly sweet and fruity, the spice is toned down - very pleasant. Honey, malt, creamy porridge, apple pie, custard. Fruity notes of pear, apple, pineapple. Ginger and chilli add spice throughout. Suggestion of wild thyme and some resinous notes from the cask are interesting as well. Dry oak leads into the finish but doesn’t dominate - it mixes with the remaining sweetness and herbal honey notes.Overall, a brilliantly crafted, Campbelltown whisky. I prefer this to Victoriana - the smoky and earthy notes give it more character and complexity, making for a more engaging experience. Highly recommended.

It would be correct to say that it actually tastes good to me. But where have the 25 years gone? Unfortunately, the PLV does not fit here. Sorry Glen Scotia. That was exactly what was exciting for me: Oak matured in the USA plus bourbon post-maturation ... and for a total of 25 years ... actually exactly mine. Admittedly great nose!Light, calm and sweet. Without missing notes. Yogurt lemon tart with vanilla powdered sugar. That's a special nose. Respect. With a little water, floral notes are added. So I like smoky too.Full-bodied and very earthy with a hint of smoke, it starts without disturbing. Wonderful vanilla with a slightly salty sea spray. The fresh oak also prevails. But everything remains too young and excited. Where's the old age?By now everyone should notice what I'm talking about. Where is the basic character of this bottle. It behaves in the finish only on a medium level. Unfortunately, he didn't hold out. Too bad."

1962,Glen Scotia 25-year-old  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"Glen Scotia 25 year old is complex, elegant and highly refined. The 48.8% ABV is incredibly well judged, offering crispness of flavours and character, without ever feeling over-powered or aggressive. Classy stuff indeed. Class rarely comes cheap and such is the case here – a look online shows a fair bit of price variance for this one from £250 upwards to almost £300 at some outlets. But, if you’re looking for an indulgence look no further. Excellent.https://www.thedramble.com/tastings/glen-scotia/glen-scotia-25-year-old/Delicate and sophisticated. Golden syrup, malts and cereals are backed up by light sea breeze and a cooling peat smoke which is part medicinal, part herbal, almost mentholated in character. There’s some hints at age here with dusty leather-bound books, oil paints, windowlene and an intriguing plasticene aroma. Vanilla and light woodiness can be detected throughout. Halfway between sitting by a fireside in an old library and walking alongside a bubbling stream whilst the dying embers of a campfire finally fade away.Oils and polish make for a full mouthfeel, but one which is never aggressive or cloying. There’s an almost Cognac-like quality to this with sharp grape and citrus juices mixing with herbal smoke and sappy, resinous wood. Toffee apples, dusty books and leather again, and now some spicing in the form of pepper and ginger. These all make for a wonderful interplay between sweeter notes and bitter, drier ones.  Underlying there’s a chalky earthiness which marries excellently with the smoke which is still on the down low, but ever-present throughout the palate – it’s both coastal and inland, with some sharper notes of medicine and iodine, and others deeper ones which offer more pungency as one might expect of a whisky from Campbeltown.Medium to long with a lovely progressive fade in the back of the palate. Wisps of smouldering oak smoke and a touch of white pepper."
1963,Glen Scotia 25-year-old  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"Freshly sawn oak, a lemon chewy candy is added. After a while I got peanuts with a hint of mint, then canned peaches and white pepper. By no means boring"

1965,Glen Scotia 25-year-old  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"Fat malt, oily, toothpaste - really! Ashtray smoke, dung. Quite bold. I like this. It’s got character. Peach, lemon, apricot, apple, oily smoke, coconut. Really nice. A mineral side, with wooly notes. Eucalyptus and a touch of lavender even. Sounds disjointed, but it works. The extra abv is essential. Really cool official 25 by Glen Scotia. Although I like it, it’s a bit of an ambitious price. Just based on price alone they are saying, we recognize that we aren’t quite on the level of Springbank, Laphroaig, but we are more desired than Glengoyne, Bunnahabhain, Caol Ila, Talisker... The Mortlach of the Hebrides?"

1967,Glen Scotia 25-year-old  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"An excellent complex and deep aroma, unfortunately, is replaced by an overly tart taste, somewhat reminiscent of not the best Irish whiskyOpen, dry, sweet berry, caramel, a little carpentry workshop, wood shavings, solvent, dry wood dust, mineral notes - stone chips, plaster, drying out brickwork; floral-citrus tones, lemon peel, some light smoky shades, smoked meats, dry herbs.Dense, rich, oak, a lot of caramel sweetness, the astringency of young bark, leather goods, tobacco, cardboard, dust, something got us wrong, grain, tablets without a shell, yes, the sweetness was not enough to compensate for these bitter-tart eruptions, dry herbs , buckwheat honey, if not for this bitterness it would be very good.Spicy, warming, caramel, leather goods, oak, a little bit of tablet bitterness, dry herbs, lemon peel."
1968,Glen Scotia 25-year-old  Classic Campbeltown Malt,Tasted on 04-14-2021. Nose is great. This whisky needs time. Complex.
1969,Glen Scotia Double Cask  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"A nice entry into glen scotia whiskys or peated whisky. Low threshold and nothing too difficult. This made me curious about the 15 YO.Soft some sherry influences. Nothing overbearing. Vanilla, caramel, fresh nutmeg, a bit of a funky peat style. And actually surprisingly sweet too.Pepper, honey, vanilla, wood and slightly oily on the palate.Salty, pepper, dried fruit."
1970,Glen Scotia Double Cask  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"This isn't as good as I remember it, there is something a little fishy about it, literally. Also musky, not a lot but it is there. The raisins, nuts, caramel and cereal are all still there. Taste wise the 46% will always give it the edge. Lots of dried fruit and a little veg with minimum spice. A medium finish with caramel and chestnut. This is a decent dram for what you pay for, no complaints here. Thanks to Peatbogger for the sample."
1971,Glen Scotia Double Cask  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"[May, 2017]  This review is on the most recent batch as it was served during the Glen Scotia open day today.As this stuff is coloured it makes no sense to describe its colour unless someone is interested in what the marketing guys at LLG see as an appropriate colour (I am not).  The nose is of a modern designed style with a mixture of vanilla sweet and sherry aromas.  Slight traces of sulphur that are no surprise as a lot of Glen Scotia sherry releases of the past were heavily spoiled by sulphur.  Obviously there was no cask management at all under the old management...The mouthfeel is warming and a little peppery, no coating at all (which I did not expect in an underage NAS edition anyhow).  The taste again reads very designed to a modern style with creamy toffee notes and a chocolatey flavour.  Not my style but easy to drink, of course.  Again slight traces of sulphur here that are bearable (anyhow, sulphur is not pleasant to me in any concentration).  The finish is short and unremarkable.Not my style of whisky but I would anyhow never have bought such a NAS standard edition (remember: Never Accept Stupid marketing!).  Nevertheless, whoever likes the modern ""designed"" whisky style will probably enjoy this dram..."
1972,Glen Scotia Double Cask  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"Solid beginner, easy to type. Not particularly complex. Price-performance ratio of up to 35 € is good, the whisky is not worth more.After about 10 minutes in the glass: slight sherry influence. Rum raisins, muesli, vanilla, toffee. Fermented fruits and cinnamon. Also sea salt. Everything set a little.Spicy start. Sweet (brown sugar). Fruits that have been fermented again, with a little acidity, plus cinnamon. Toffee and raisins. Vanilla.Medium length. Oak seasoning, cinnamon, fruit acid."
1973,Glen Scotia Double Cask  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"For me, it’s perhaps the least favourite of what I have tried from the Glen Scotia range, but still nice though. The nose promises just a little more than the taste can give as it gets a bit one-dimensional there. But all in all a nice daily dram, especially if you take the price into consideration.Some sherry influences at first, with mostly blueberries and red berries. This is followed by green apples and vanilla. Some caramel as well. Then a hint of lemons and also some toffee.Caramel. Pencil shavings. But also a sour note from lemons. Toffee and honey. Wood. Followed by some spices, such as black peppercorns, a pinch of ginger and cinnamon. A touch of bitterness from roasted coffee beans.Slightly drying and somewhat oaky. With the same spices as can be found on the palate."
1974,Glen Scotia Double Cask  Classic Campbeltown Malt,"On the nose, we can fell the sherry influence, with lots of honeyed spices, dried fruits, oranges, peaches and a hint of smoke.The taste is sweet and sour and silky!

1989,Glenallachie 12-year-old,"When Billy Walker said in an interview that 'running GlenAllachie is fun', he caught my interest. Can you have a better motivation? With its selection of PX, Oloroso and virgin casks, the 12-year-old expression offers a busy nose. Fruity acidity, butterscotch and shortbread are followed by cinnamon, clay and fresh mint. Full-bodied, peppery and slightly mineral, the taste features banana, sage and hints of mocha. After Eights, citrus zest and jelly babies accompany the cask-dominated finish. There are no shortcuts to quality, and this malt is ticking all the boxes.RATING: 3.9/5.0 stars ≙ 86 pts → FIRST-CLASS [-]"
1990,Glenallachie 12-year-old,"After a huge disappointment in the 25YO I needed something to salveage my view on the new Glenallachie core range. Less than half the age, more than twice as good.Thanks to Slàinte Mhath for both the sample and the resurected faith in the brand.Quite a lot going on here. And it's very ballanced, none of the casks have put in a very dominant component.Sherry notes on sweet red fruits. Zesty sweet tangerine and yellow fruits. A little sour fresh wood, with vanilla and cinnamon. Green banana peel.Just think of something you like in a whisky, and I'm sure you will pick it up here.Creamy texture.Arrives with more spice than let on by the nose.

1992,Glenallachie 12-year-old,"The smell is fruity and pleasant, a mixture of light sweet notes and a gentle acidity.  When tasting, I immediately think of a juicy green color, the sour impressions begin to dominate.  The finish is pleasant, but not very versatile.

1995,Glenallachie 12-year-old,"A pleasant surpise to me. It's aromatic and offers a lot of flavour! The virgin oak works well with the PX and oloroso casks.A pleasure to nose this one, so many aromas! It's floral and fruity: citrus and banana with vanilla and coconut. The virgin oak is speaking clearly! But there's also some coffee, caramel, baguette, clay and oregano.Starts fruity on apples, peaches, grapes and bitter mandarins before several spices pop up: pepper, ginger and a generous dose of liquorice. Becomes quite oaky after a while, and also vegetal notes and chocolate cookies reveal itselves. A lively palate!Apricot, vanilla, white chocolate and a fresh and refined spiciness: peppermint, aniseed and liquorice."

1997,Glenallachie 12-year-old,"The wooden rail was used. The trick also worked on the nose. But at the back it is too modern and not set enough. Too little body, but the PLV is ok. Because the age is commendable.Light, freshly cut wood with notes of vanilla and a little honey on the banana. Standard and briefly explained, but very appealing. Great nose. Respect.A little of everything but enough of nothing! Sherry? Well done on the palate just too flat. What it has is a dense network of malt and wort. The palate does not keep what the nose promised.Medium to rather short. It remains fruity and spicy but somehow minerally simple. It's a shame that he didn't hold out. Unfortunately not convincing me. Modern standard. PLV good."
1998,Glenallachie 12-year-old,"Billy walkers new project. These new Glenallachie expressions are at best at younger age. The 10 cs batch 1 and this 12yo are very high quality for money if you ask me. In my opinion the 18 and 25 just don’t cut it. I have had the privilege of attending a master class of Billy walker himself in The Hague last year. What made a great impression on me was the excess of transparency. There are no secrets at all which is a very, very good thing. Choices they make, combinations of casks used etc.Well back to this whisky. If this is their ‘doorstep’ as a brand, a ‘get to know you better’ for us malt geeks, well I certainly do want to enter their premises!Well hello what an arrival! This is a very pleasant nose! It’s fresh, sweet, spicy, fruity floral. There is a lot going on inhere! My first impression is that the nose appears to be more mature then the stated age would suggest. I wouldn’t be suprised if there is quite a big volume of older whisky involved. This is complex stuff. You can tell that a lot of different cask types are involved. Apple pie, butter, Cream, orange, banana and vanilla. Also some hints of red fruit. And a fresh virgin cask twist.Creamy and well rounded. No flaws or rough edges. It is very friendly and well layered. All the different tastes are very well integrated. Orangepeel, ripe Banana’s. Buttery mouthfeel. Very pleasant.Medium-long length. Very wood spice influenced with cane sugar and some licorice. All the different types of wood seem to be passing the palate. Very pleasant. Top quality stuff!"
1999,Glenallachie 15-year-old,"Extremely vain and very settled on the sour side of the spectrum. Nutty-fermented sherry notes. Rather sultanas as raisins. Juicy, sparkling, astringent. Despite the massive role played by the finish here, I got the impression that the Glenallachie character (as Billy Walker is trying to shape it) still has something on it, because among all the forest fruit juiciness there is always a kräutrige, Almost vegetable note (rosemary and artichokes?), which I found in the 12er the most interesting aspect. In addition, I would strongly suspect that even this bottling virgin oak has seen: from about the middle of the flavor development is a pretty violent spiciness, which suggests that some very fresh (or even virgin) barrels with Vatting flowed.  Positively seen: a strong sherrylastiger Malt, which nevertheless does not come to set or even superimposed comes along and offers an interesting balance of acid, spice and spirit.  On the negative side: a malt that seems to be more ""assembled"" than harmoniously matured, and in whose price range and drum composition I would always prefer the current Glendronach 15."
2000,Glenallachie 15-year-old,"It's not going to be easy to be objective here. It is interesting from the PLV point of view and for beginners from two sides. On the one hand, it brings many flavors to the front without being expensive. On the other hand, it has a nice color with enough texture to become a friend. But, .. the comparison with the 25 exposed the 15 extremely. Because the 15 already looks a bit strange on the nose. The slightly one-dimensional sherry note comes across almost synthetic. The PX sweetness is more dominant than the Oloroso fruit note. Here someone has put on the PX sherry board. Rather direction mass compatible. SorrySo really an aha effect when pouring. Wow. Somewhat light, ""sweet"" chocolate and strong and very sweet grape notes come through. Minimal toffee and ... unfortunately, only ""light"" fruit notes. But a great nose!This 15er had seen European oak for a long time and that without a doubt, because the mouth area immediately fills with a woody flavor that is very dominant, but is not bitter. Also a PX liquorice comes through with a light leather saddle. It's perfectly alright. After the spiciness comes a tour of the Christmas market. Also, and even a little nutty, it goes over into the finish. That saved him the 84 points. ;)The farewell is medium to normal and is really ok for this price. So the PLV is really good. Because here you get a standard whisky at a higher level. Well, I definitely have fond memories of it. Respect to Glenallachie. The 15 is the reparation for the sometimes weird pricing policy. A big thank you to André for the big sample."
2001,Glenallachie 15-year-old,"Walker said: “I’ve been working on our 15 year old release since we acquired GlenAllachie back in October 2017. In that time I’ve been intimately following the development of the various casks and I believe the 15 year old is the perfect balance of distillery and cask influence.”https://theglenallachie.com/release-of-the-glenallachie-15-year-old/He added: “For this 15 year old, I chose PX and Oloroso puncheons and hogsheads to deliver complete depth and finish. This whisky is rich in sweet spices, raisins and butterscotch, with waves of banana, orange peel and dark chocolate.

2008,Glenallachie 15-year-old,"March 2021:Glenallachie 15y VS Glenallachie 10y Cask Strength Batch 2 VS Glenallachie 10y Cask Strength Batch 3 VS Glenallachie 10y Cask Strength Batch 4first of all i must say that i am a bit preoccupied after buying a bottle of the 12 year old, which was my biggest disappointment in 2020. making the bottle empty was a real struggle for me. there is this bitter wood note which annoys me so much. tastes as if 8th fill casks have been used. especially after it has been hyped quite a bit i was a bit confused how people could enjoy this stuff that much. i asked myself if there was somethin wrong with me? it was almost a whisky identity crisis... eventually the bottle ended as a mixer for highballs, which was quite ok :)but back to the actual match today. the cask strengths and the 15y old battle of allachies. starting with the 15y it is a massive upgrade to the 12y standard bottling. it shows very elegant and ripe notes for its age. could be at least 3 years older in my opinion. if there wouldnt be this bitter thing in the middle of the palate, this would be a 87-88 whisky for me. now i´m wondering if it is maybe the distillery character and not a virgin oak or overused cask i am talking about here?cask strength batch 2 was a big disappointment for me today. very grainy and this bitter note i already mentioned before was very dominant. it almost hurts when i taste it. reminds me of the dark times with the 12 year old. i mean, am i the only one getting this?cask strength batch 3 was my absolute favorite of the evening. everything very rounded. the sherry ifluence is much stronger here, but still leaves some air for the actual spirit to show its character. rather sweet and very rounded. nice stuff. batch 4, unfortunately, shows more similarities to batch 2 (bad batch) than to batch 3 (good batch). these unrounded grain notes combined with this bitter thingy which i dislike makes the whole experience rather challenging, but not in a good way. the sherry influence helps it a bit. still, not my thing. all in all a very interesting but rather disappointing experience to be honest. i hope that one day i will try a glenallachie who does not shows me this bitter and dry thing which annoys me so much. batch 3 already goes in a nice direction, but i think (or actually hope) there is more :)light and delicate, fresh nuts, red fruit but not on the dry side, semolina pudding. very elegant. no aggressiveness or anything disturbing to find here. hints of oak show themselfs in the back. after some time heavier nutnotes pop up. maybe some hay? comforting. after some time some leather comes thorugh. milk chocolate and very ripe fruits. molasses.beautiful texture, light and crisp on the palate. it has something which already annoyed me with the 12 year old. i thought that it was the virgin oak, but in the 15 year old there shouldnt be any (right?). it somehow stings my brain a bit... if it would be possible to leave out this bitter dry wood note, it would be a wonderful dram for me.the finish is a bit harsh when compared to the palate and nose. still, rather longlasting with ginger and dry oak. when compared to the CS batch 2 or 4, the funny thing is that this bitter part comes in the middle of the palate and then disappears. so there isnt any in the finish."
2009,Glenallachie 18-year-old,"[September, 2018] Somehow I am sceptical if a purely blend-oriented distillery offers a single malt core range from one day to another - just because the owner changed. This whisky was produced 18 years ago when nobody ever thought of a Glenallachie single malt bottling. So can this be really good?...finally it is better than most other standard single malt whiskies these days, what is an achievement in itself. It is not really earth-moving but easy-to-drink and without any obvious flaw. Nevertheless this unknown malt (for the broader market) is completely overpriced according to my taste buds (but the investors want a return, what else?)...The nose offers a washy-malty profile with delicate heather honeys, barley sugars, some shy herbs and the smell of a well-equipped flower shop in the midst of summer. It is not really bold and impressive but it is balanced and enjoyable. After some time of breathing an interesting and delicious aroma of roasted coffee beans pops up...The palate is rather two-dimensional on sugary sweet and bitter herbal (tannins from the wood) flavours. If you chew it for a while the roasted coffee beans flavour pops up again which is quite nice. Water turns the dram smoother and releases some additional milk chocolate and less bitter flavours. I like it best somewhat reduced.The dram arrives warming and coating on the palate with a slightly bitter-astringent feeling from heavy tannins. The finish is of medium length with more shy milk chocolatey flavours and a slightly astringent end (tannins again)."
2010,Glenallachie 18-year-old,"I do not like - the nose is too common for my age and the price range - with patience you will find a few nice flavors here, but on the palate and finish it falls even further. I am glad that I do not have 10cl or even a bottle of it.  Really very intense he is for his alcohol content - who the style is - because the price may go ok - not for my taste.Apple, apple cider vinegar, flour dust, artificial not particularly pleasant citrus note, as I know of many modern flora & fauna bottlings from the Bourboncask and there already did not like, citrus peel, multivitamin candies, cheap multivitamin ""nectar"", then again beautiful citrus oil and orange oil, sweet curly Grass, ripe mild wood notes, tea and flower aromas - unfortunately very hidden behind the obtrusive ZItrusnote that exerts on me the charm of a toilet blockfresh - mint, pepper and citrus oil bring pleasant freshness, walnut shells, Grapefriutschale, equally noticeable bitterness on the palate - I do not feel it is too bitter - but especially delicious just not, beautiful creamy oak, sweet sour basic note with a light ZItronenaroma - The association probably comes from the mint oil, to light sherry notes - but these flash only briefly, then drown in citrus and bitter grapefruit peel.  he tingles - as of coal acid on the palate - a mixture of spice and Sprittigkeit  I do not like what I like -brings me nothing new, medium to long, but mostly bitter - everything else is subordinate to that for me (I've already had half a dram yesterday, there it was as well)"

2014,Glenallachie 18-year-old,"An uncomplicated, easy-drinking single malt from The GlenAllachie. A dram that may disappoint fans of (heavily) sherried whiskies, but which offers the opportunity to capture more subtle flavours that have not been overpowered by the sherry, such as honey, vanilla, toffee and yellow fruits. A whisky that is good to spend time with.I thank Kirsch Import e.K. for the complimentary sample! https://www.whisky-connaisseur.de/2020/12/16/glenallachie-18yo-2018/Sweet on the nose with vanilla and butterscotch. With time, citrus fruits emerge, accompanied by toffee, icing sugar, a touch of oak and ginger, with a pinch of cinnamon and marzipan in the background.Creamy and sweet on the palate with honey, sultanas, peach and toffee. This is accompanied by a warming spiciness with oak, nutmeg and pepper. Some marzipan and traces of dark chocolate linger towards the finish.The finish is long lasting, creamy sweet and warming with vanilla, fruit jam, toffee and some dry oak.With water: After adding a few drops of water, more citrus fruits on the nose, accompanied by vanilla and toffee. Still sweet and creamy on the palate, but also clearly spicier with oak, pepper and nutmeg. Fruity with apricot and plums, some marzipan and a pinch of cinnamon. The finish is a little shorter, creamy and sweet with fruit jam and warming spices."
2015,Glenallachie 18-year-old,"The nose is the best part of this 18yo Glenallachie. The nose and first half of taste give quite some fruits, mainly oranges and apples. But also something sour like vinegar. Midpalate the fruity vinegar aromas continue but it also turns bitter with quite some bitter spices like pepper, nutmeg and bitter wood. Not very complex and a profile you have to like to justify it’s price."
2016,Glenallachie 18-year-old,"Had this at a digital tasting with glenallachie.It is quite interesting, sweet and oaky. But for that price I can get better balanced whiskys. Still nice.Quite easy on the nose.Eucalyptus and Mint, oak, vanilla, orange cest, butterscotch.Very juicy and mouthwatering, and quite dry, also very sweet again, white chocolate, cocoa powder, dark fruits,This is a nice finish but not to complex. Oak driven and spicy, but not unpleasant, then vanilla and orange cest is quite present, pear jam?. Cool but not to exciting."
2017,Glenallachie 18-year-old,"The smell is very pleasant with little surprises and depth, but stimulating and delicious.  In the mouth is a little less pleasing, the sulfur is a slight false note for me.  The departure is a bit inconsequential.  Whisky does not hurt anyone, but it does not inspire anyone. To drink it casually, he is quite nice, but for the enjoyment something is missing.Fruity, a lot of peach, some lime, some raspberry, behind it vanilla, only a little oak, all soft and beautiful,Fairly mild onset, soft body, delicate tickling on the tongue, slight oak note, noticeable sulfur, apricot and peach, dates, malt  in the second sip the sulfur has disappearedSomething oak, the sulfur sounds only slightly, malt, apricot, slight bitterness, not too long"
2018,Glenallachie 18-year-old,"A sentence with ""x"", that was probably nothing. This malt is just too bitter for me, only the nose could convince halfway. White pepper is still sticking to the palate, bitter and tart wood elements mingle with sour citrus fruits. With a lot of good will, I award 80 points today ...  21/19/20/20 (80P)Pale amber shines in the glass while an oily streak forms on the glass wall, from which small drops gradually dissolve. Creamy toasty aromas rise, malt and vanilla blend with hints of slightly sour fruit flavors. The nose is relatively one-dimensional, from time to tickle the alcohol discreetly in the nose. Citrus fruits blend with a slightly grassy and floral aroma, slowly appearing dried dates and raisins. For a moment, naturally-fermented apple juice comes to my mind ...Herb and bitter the first sip flows over the tongue, I fold my nose and make my face like if I would bite into the shell of a grapefruit ... What's that? Suddenly spicy mountain cheese stings through the bitter citrus aromas, tart wood tones stick to the palate, a touch of white pepper runs through the throat and lays sharp over the tongue. Rancid and bitter walnut flavors appear, the flavor of this Glenallachie is far too bitter and bitter.Herb, bitter, Grapefruit, ...."
2019,Glenallachie 21-year-old  Batch Number One,It is exciting to see which price escapades our favourite topic whisky triggers. This bottling was quoted by Glenallachie as having an issue price of 199 pounds. Except for the English dealers nobody seems to orientate himself on this issue price anymore...
2020,Glenallachie 21-year-old  Batch Number One,"A really excellent dram. What I particularly like about this single malt is that it is not overpowered by the sherry. Obviously those PX casks were selected that provided great chocolate aromas to the maturing whisky. The result is an outstanding balance of dark fruit, cocoa and chocolate as well as pleasantly warming spices. A symbiosis of flavours that results in a truly delicious pleasure experience. Well done!I thank The GlenAllachie Distillery for the complimentary sample! https://www.whisky-connaisseur.de/2020/11/12/glenallachie-21yo-2020-batch-number-one/Rich sherry aromas flow immediately into the nose, accompanied by Christmas cake, dark fruit and juicy oranges. Delicious spices of cinnamon and nutmeg mix with lots of cocoa and dark chocolate. Candied orange peel, notes of walnuts and a hint of tobacco leaves linger in the background. Wow - what a fantastic nose.On the palate also immediately the classic sherry aromas with sweet Christmas cake, stewed plums and oranges. In addition warming spices of cinnamon, nutmeg and oak. The creaminess is increasingly replaced by dry cocoa notes and dark chocolate.The finish is long-lasting and pleasantly warming. Creamy, almost sticky fruit jam mingles with dry oak spice, ginger, cocoa notes and subtle walnut. Wonderful!With water: After adding a few drops of water fresher on the nose with lots of juicy oranges, butterscotch, orange blossom and milk chocolate. This is accompanied by cinnamon and notes of walnut in the background. Continues to be wonderfully sweet on the palate with oranges, heather honey and fruit cake, accompanied by dark chocolate. Discreetly warming with spicy tones of cinnamon, nutmeg and some ginger. The finish is still long, pleasantly warming and creamy with butterscotch, orange marmalade and chocolate. Subtle oak spice and a touch of walnut towards the end."
2021,Glenallachie 21-year-old  Batch Number One,"Solid Oak and resinous that didn't stay long, sherry wine, followed by liquorice. Light rubber quickly turned broiled meat with salt. Blurred sour plum and dried fig didn't last long either. Rich red apples especially from the sides of the glass. Grape jam, cherry, caramel. Slight grass, turned hay. A hint of earth. Then full of orange with a little bit sourness, tobacco. A lot of almond after breathing. Near the rim bottom of the glass, there were pear and walnuts. Mandarin oranges from the rim top. Skewed fruits. More mandarin orange after a sip.Apple, caramel, cherry, mild pepper. Sour citrus. Tea also kicked in. Sweetness went up within 10s and stayed for a while. More oily and grassy later. Pears with peel, also some watery dark chocolate. Honey, nutty, pomelo peel. The body tasted like jam-ish. Towards the end, vanilla and pepper at the back of the mouth.Citrus with a little bit of papaya. Mild pepper. Cinnamon and tea, a bit astringent. Pear peel emerged after 30s."
2022,Glenallachie 21-year-old  Batch Number One,"Nose: Rich fruity aroma, elements of dried fruit, dates, very pleasant aroma.Taste: From the very first sip, this whisky is perceptible in its multi-layered nature. A great balance between sherry and dried fruit. Additionally, some cinnamon spices and cookies. It really was good and very enjoyable!Rating: 90 | 100 The finish is quite long, rather towards tea and chocolate. It was a really good thing for me!"

2031,Glenallachie 25-year-old,"The 25 extremely exposed the 15 because it is an interesting malt on the nose. It shows how the 15 is more compatible with the masses. But, only on the nose. The 25 is unfortunately on Loser Street from the mouth and that also has to do with the PLV. Here there is a lack of down-to-earth attitude and perseverance.A very light fresh nose. Interwoven smells spread like a dream and make you linger. The wood and the sherry are in harmony and spread a fruity and leathery tobacco note. Everything even has a slightly mineral and mentholic effect. There is always a little apricot in the mind towards the end of the nose. Oranges and lemons are also present. Perfectly balanced. Respect to that nose.In terms of texture, it loses a lot of what the nose promised. Oily and creamy, yes, ... but now the wood spices and pepper with ginger prevail. In the transition to the finish, it makes a little impression again with a fine mineral menthol note and this fine lemon grass again and again. That has something and just makes it look good again. But I'll stick with it, the price is too high and excessive.Medium to long, but only because of the imposed sharpness that does not want to end. One comes to think about whether the age can be right. Because now a well-made 20 throws away the last points. Age or not, the respect for good barrel management remains. Without doubt. A big thank you to André for the big sample."
2032,Glenallachie 25-year-old,"Tasted at Tunsberg Whisky Festival 2019Have to say this was probably the biggest disappointment of what I tried out.I expect more from a 25YO, also more from an almost £250 bottle.The nose is not bad, there's a zesty fruityness as well as darker notes of chocolate and leather.Quite a bit of spice in there, in fact it smells hot and the alc is very noticeable for a 48%It arrives sweet on red fruits and chocolate.Then a rather rapid build up of spice as the more yellow and zesty elements takes over.I find it completely out of ballance, it's eratic and almost nervous.Sometimes unpredictable can be interesting, here it just made it difficult to focus on anything.The finish is at first dominated by spices, hot spices.Then the wood takes over the wheel and drive this whisky deep into the ditch. The tannins are mouthpuckering dry, and with the spice still lingering it gets almost unpleasant.It doesn't help that this dryness sticks very long."
2033,Glenallachie 25-year-old,"Delicate fruity notes of orange peel and sultanas, but it also showcases a distinct aroma of rye bread. Slightly nutty (macadamia), with a hint of cigar tobacco, honey and leather, as well as milk chocolate. Finally some soy. Great balance.Dark chocolate and oranges, a classic combination that works really well. A hint of menthol here too. Some sultanas and almond oil, as well as marmalade. Gentle spices.Spices and very subtle gentian root, with hints of mandarine."
2034,Glenallachie 25-year-old,"Well, given the fact this is a pricey 25yo whisky, it's also really good. At least, in my opinion. This Glenallachie gives you full on aroma's of apple, orange and mandarin marmalade, sweet but fresh honey and something nuttiness. It's also a bit floral, giving it nice green'ish touch. Midpalate also gives some red berries and fudge, hence the sherry barrels being used. The finish is a tad tart, but nevertheless, this is quality whisky! Is it worth the price? One should decide for himself."
2035,Glenallachie 25-year-old,"Taking into account the prices that is again no revelation. For me something is missing here. In addition, the spice is a little too dominant for me. Of course a good malt. You should try it (at least as a fan of Billy Walker). I would not buy it again.Fresh pastries. Vanilla, nuts, dough. In secret, one comes to Orange. Again very complex, there is much to discover here. Alcohol is not noticeable.peppery notes, here you notice the 48% Vol. Will be much rounder and sweeter. Nice sweet note. Mouthfeel is very oily and creamy. Has a little bit of creamy caramel candy. I find here again some organs or citrus notes.Taking into account the prices that is again no revelation. For me something is missing here. In addition, the spice is a little too dominant for me. Of course a good malt. You should try it (at least as a fan of Billy Walker). I would not buy it again."
2036,Glenallachie 25-year-old,"Good amount of white fruits, like pears, guavas, unripened apples, white peaches, and honey dew, but these are not the sticky, ripened, juicy fruits that i like. Some cane juice. Mentos chewy mints. Pretty good.Continuation of the nose with the delicate fruits but doesn't evolve in the palate, nor is it very complex. Pavan liqueur. Mezcal notes. A bit malty and grassy. It just doesn't seem to be complete to be honest.Okay finish. It's like being stranded on third base and the guy on the plate struck out."
2037,Glenallachie 25-year-old,"It is delicious, but there is no 25-year or even 250-euro enthusiasm, similar delicious and adult I get at some other OA at 18 for 100 € and less.first spicy, leathery, a little nut and tobacco, later it becomes fruity - first raisins, then lemons / oranges with sugar, a hint of mead ... the longer in the glass, the less ""old"" it lookson arrival strong orange and milk chocolate / nougat, raisins and dark chocolate up to dark berry jam with cocoa and spicescreamy when swallowing, then slowly warming, drinking cocoa, gentle pungency"
2038,Glenallachie 25-year-old,"Glenallachie 25 years, 48%  I think that's the most aromatic of the four new bottlings. Even the darkest. What a nice color.  The whole thing stays true: intense oak, a little sherry. Anyone looking for a sherry bomb is wrong here. Very subtly, the sweetness of the sherry with the wood, robs a bit of spice and bitterness.  Spicy, tart with juniper berries, wet wood and some leather in the foreground.  In the finish long and strong.  Class!"

I must say that, contrary to the opinion of most of my acquaintances, he did not make such an impression on me.Ink, Georgian grape marshmallow, a little musty. Old Soviet cough syrup, an old soldier's belt and my grandfather's harness with the corresponding smell of that leather and gun oil.Sweet, luscious, industrial, technical. Free candy, lollipops, which are on the racks in car centers, airport departure areas and other public places.A bit like bourbon with its caramel tones. But overall, technical, short-lived and lusciously sweet."

2049,Glenburgie 05-year-old  Glenburgie-Glenlivet,"Nose: The thin smoke envelopes other aromas. Below is a variety of old cane water, comprehensive tropical juices, cinnamon, sand ginger powder, OBE, and then smoked aggravated, roasted sunflower seeds, roasted olives, the whole is still very good Vigorous, refreshing, full, and complex, like a centenarian with an immortal face. Drink: The wine has a smooth body, but too much OBE can only capture some content at the end of the side branch."

Sour apfel, gooseberry and honey, in addition a small herb garden, out of which rosemary and thyme stand out.

2054,Glenburgie 05-year-old  Glenburgie-Glenlivet,"Not an exceptional malt, but a pleasant experience and a nice journey into the past. Pleasant dram for sociable evenings or starters in a tasting, for more he lacks the depth and also the highlights.First, some sourish fruit, with light honey in the background. A few herbs (rosemary!) And some oak is also to be found. The tart note decreases significantly with increasing time in the glass, which has a very positive effect on the overall impression. The honey-herbal mixture is quite interesting and makes the malt, especially in conjunction with the oak, appear much riper.Very mild and gentle, as if it was meant too well with the addition of water. It will take a few seconds to really show up. Offers a sweet and slightly fruity character, without big highlights. From today's point of view, I would say - too young to be so ""bottled"" bottled.Short and sweet, but pleasant. Some oak, even the honey is still there. A mixture of lovage, vanilla pods and licorice lays on the tongue."

2059,Glenburgie 15-year-old  Special Distillery Bottling - Allied,"[February, 2007]  Together with friends I emptied a bottle that I bought for 42 Euro in February, 2007.  This is one bottling out of six for a special millennium edition intended for sale to Allied employees only but as it was rather weakish a lot of bottles found their way into specialist retail shops for quite a lot of money back then (150 Deutschmark = 77 Euro in mid 2000).  In my old rating system (ten scales that translate into WB points: 50 - 66 - 75 - 80 - 82,5 - 85 - 87,5 - 90 - 92,5 - 95) I scored it 82,5.  My notes state a dry sherry profile but with quite some flaws.  Nevertheless one of the better bottlings out of this edition.  But why bottled Allied such flawed stuff for their employees?"

It seems Allied were ahead of their time, presenting this at a bottling strength of 46%.N: Good power/weight, fruity for sure – and “a mix of bourbon and sherry casks”, I ask? “Certainly”, say Tristan – no doubt [sherry] transport casks from the 1980s [and before]. This wholly blended/consolidated malt speaks of mineral-y ashy trodden-in phenols and well-stewed fruits, [not dusty] waxy transistors – ‘old & rare styley’.T: Definitely ‘old skool’ with some OBE. It’s a little soft/thin and peppery [also after 20+ years in glass], yet there’s lovely calm sweetness [with water – prickly neat] and a complimenting bitter “blackcurrant” note, says Tristan – a spirit character note. Also noteworthy: dusty, ashy, fruity, chocolatey,… slightly waxy weighty mouthfeel. Like a blend in its own right, it’s one that sustains flat on the palate.F: Rolls on calmly with the softest of prickles and onto a dusty easter egg milk chocolatey confectionary orchard-fruity finish.C: Not without quibbles, and perhaps this particular bottle is a little flabby, but I’m a sucker for this older style.

Promising nose for a 40% abv bottling.A rather thin mouthfeel, sweetish, some vanilla with a light fruitiness of the apples and pears from the nose, mildly dring wood.

Apples in the background and a touch of vanilla and caramel. Very fruity, very sweet. Typically Speyside. A nose that will appeal to those who appreciate it rather sweet, even to those who thought they did not like whisky.Soft, fruity, very light. Again this is, I think, the right plan to introduce whisky to someone reluctant. Always a note of pears but we are mainly on cooked apples, not really an apple pie but we find biscuit notes.

Having just spent a few days with some Art Directors at our company... This sort of thing is what you guys do in a glass.The nose is magic on this, loaded malt sweet and tinned Mandarin syrup. Turkish coffee and a whack of baked pasty and black pepper. It's not mint but rather camphor, like Mentholatum. This is the honey and heather that you hear about in other Speyside drams.The palate is equally huge, she's a monster! Huge sweet notes with autumn leaves and hints of fall walks... Mineral wetness of stones, lichens/moss and dry leaves. Freshness and a touch of lavender and anise.The finish is long, super oily and super lush richness. I mean I can't explain how long, like 6-10 minutes... The sweets drive in and start to cover the finish, camphor comes back and baking notes come in. Tea leaves and licorice (the real stuff)."

Soft and delicate, a nose for any occasion. Subtle notes of oak coming with even a hint of burnt wood. With water the nose loses its edge.Not as delicate as the nose, big arrival with those peaches and nectarines on the attack. Big serving of wood spice in the middle with a slight touch of sour oak. Holding in the mouth the oak disappears and you're left with sweet fruit juice. With water it loses the fun of the journeyDrying, fruity and gentle providing the perfect ending to this lovely dram."

There is pear, peach and a little apple in syrup with single cream.Then some apricot, its quite light and refreshing.Quite long and sweet at the finish"
2102,Glenburgie 1997  Chivas Brothers - Cask Strength Edition,"The nose is fantastic. I absolutely loved it. The palate is a bit too much, very rough. But this is still a nice whisky. Approved :)Fruity with lemons zest and pineapple. Also some cumin seeds, accompanied by honey. Next a more farmy aspect with hay and straw. Some wood shavings also.Chalky, waxy and fruity (citrus). Fairly spicy, maybe even too much. Sharp and overly alcoholic. This could use some water.Pear, pepper and it ends with some nice green fruits."

2105,Glenburgie 1999  The Distillery Reserve Collection,"True representation of Chivas Brothers' Glenburgie - Ballantine's 17 without the grain and the smoke.Enjoy straight - **Not a swimming**Big hit of alcohol, quite sharp and needs a little breathe. With time its gentleness and subtle character begins to show. Lemon tea with a pinch of sugar, Glenburgie's classic red apples minus the peel. Also something slightly herbal in there. With water you're taking to a green field to enjoy the iced lemon tea with a plate of peaches to snack on.Fruity and sweet, red apples with a dash of lemon peel on the side with a big helping of prickly alcohol. With water it goes bad, the sweetness drops, the fruitiness drops and its becomes slightly sour and acidic.Drying with some subtle oak and a wedge of sugar coated dried lemon. With water the finish loses the sugared lemon and serves up a big helping of sour oak."

2108,Glencadam 10-year-old,"This relatively young whisky was a real nice surprise. It is different. It is tasteful. Naturally presented. And for a friendly price. One word springs in mind: buy!Nice aromatic wood. Vanilla. Sweet perfume. Fresh citrus fruit. Savoury fresh herbs.With water the nose is sweeter, softer, more balanced.Hot alcohol arrival. Bitter development of fresh grapefruit. Dry. Dried savoury herbs.With water the arrival is sweet and bitter. And short. The development takes over from a dry bitter into juicy fresh citrus fruits of all sorts.A citrussy finish with dry savoury herbs in the end."
2109,Glencadam 10-year-old,"Quick hit review.Glencadam might not be on everyone's radar, so I was curious to taste this malt. Fresh citrus, honeydew melon and hints of glue reach my nose, followed by thyme, vanilla and pineapple. Quite sweet and vivid, the palate unfolds with honey, lemon zest and mild spices. A touch of white wine, ginger and the ever-present citrus remain in the aftertaste. Not the most complex dram, but well-made and enjoyable!RATING: 3.5/5.0 stars ≙ 83 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE"
2110,Glencadam 10-year-old,"I was surprised at how good this whisky is, a real easy sipper with enough flavour to keep you interested."
2111,Glencadam 10-year-old,"Color: Straw gold.  ABV: 46%.  Nose: Spirituous, bright. Freshly cut grass, sour dried fruits, a piece of wood, an oak barrel, a lemon with sugar. [n20]  Taste: Bright, sweet. Pear, apple, lemon is gone (sorry). Pepper and spices. [t17]  Finish: long, simple. Sweetness, vanilla, cereals. Somewhere far is milk chocolate. [f18]  Balance: Not a bad drink, which seemed to me to be excessively aggressive. Maybe because of the heat, maybe because of what else. Very interestingly decorated with vanilla. It seems banal sugar, then manifests itself. A good sour lemon in a scent that, to disappointment, completely disappears in taste. Freshness I would like more, with such a flavor, which more or less draws this drink. A bottle would not take. [b19]  Score n + t + f + b: 74"
2112,Glencadam 10-year-old,A nice surprise: it's a light but very lively fresh summer dram with a fruity finish.
2113,Glencadam 10-year-old,"This is really a good, clean and well defined 10 year old. The nose is tangy with a distinct vanilla note and an astringent suggestion of overripe peach. The taste is floral and sweet with some bourbon cask influence impinging on the tastebuds. The finish is medium long and spicy with a hint of sherry in the background. Overall, a well balanced expression well inside daily dram territory."
2114,Glencadam 10-year-old,"It’s a proper, decently fruity, light single malt that works on most occasions.Light and spirit forward with fruits like mush banana, green grapes and a touch of mango, but also a fair amount of vanilla custard.Sweet vanilla arrival and barley sugar with a spicy follow-up. Slightly peppery and a touch of chalk also. Finally a whiff of straw.More of the same. Short to medium in length."
2115,Glencadam 10-year-old,"Quite a hyped bottle these days. Many online voices have praised this 10 year old so it obviously has to be tried out. It does tick all the boxes with regards to integrity, and as such its quality is apparent in and of its own merits. As a daily drinker this is a very good choice if you like the fresh and fruity profile of a young whisky. Its honest, almost naked in its appearance and as such much appreciated, but I must admit its not always the style I prefer. Some days I adore Glencadam 10 and others I almost resent it. Its a mood dependent whisky. Still very recommended though.Lycee fruit, glycerin, mango syrup, pomelo and lime, unripe pears, green apples. Fresh sage and a hint of tarragon. Very feisty and ""spiny"" in the nose. Young but composed and complex.Lime and lemon juice. Unripe passion fruit. Green crispy apples. Green hazel nuts. Blood grapefruit. Chardonnay. Tastes quite young, but still fairly balanced.Drying out on the bitterness of green herbs, berries and fruit peels. Tinges of citrus appear."
2116,Glencadam 10-year-old,
2117,Glencadam 10-year-old,"Fruity-fresh, classic Speyside profile with pears and grapes, plus a little soap. Pleasantly sweet in taste but with a bit too fresh oak spice. Overall decent but interchangeable malt. Length: 4/10 Grade: 2-"
2118,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"A whisky with a very strong character with all the properties that one could wish for at a tasting. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but to discover something of everything. One of the good guys among the 15s.Roasted aromas over salted nuts with grassy floral notes with a hint of mint. A very balanced vanilla nose and slowly fading into citrus notes. Remains grainy and on the dry side. But fine.A very strong mouthfeel. The pepper plays the main role and distributes sweet malty notes. At the same time it keeps what the nose promised with a floral feeling.Medium and peppery, very pleasant. All in all, a recommendation from the PLV. Not a highlight! The 21 is much more adult."
2119,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"Aroma: vanilla, caramel, light citrus notes  Taste: vanilla, spices, oak  Finish: Medium long and spicy  Comment: Good strong and natural Malt - 87 points"
2120,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"RATING: 85pts – |83 – 86 (B) → Good| — Not a “must”, but a nice-to-have.The nose is quite fresh and citric with notes of ripe lemons, vanilla followed by nice creaminess and minerality.The taste is fresh again and sour sweet with a profile of apricots, lemons with sugar and some chalk.The finish is medium lenght and has notes of vegetable, vanilla, fresh cut wood and wet stones."
2121,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"Nearly as good as the 13-y.o. ""The Re-awakening"", which boasts a cleaner, crisper finish and therefore stays ahead by one point.All on clean, citric fruitiness and dry, spicy oak. No frills, no tricks, nothing flashy, rather dignified indeed. Very deep and refined nose at this age; seems older than it is.A freshly opened bottle (or sample) may come across as too tart and austere, but with time, air, and a splash of water it becomes a thing of beauty: Creamy, rich, jam-packed with super clean ex-bc flavors. Apricot, honey, assorted breakfast cereals, bitter (or blood) oranges, and a chalky minerality. Like many Glencadams, it becomes a bit bitter at the death, which may not be for everyone, but if you like this kind of style (which I do), it's pretty flawless. Also very condensed and rich for 46%; takes water well and keeps on changing with almost every glass you pour.Glencadam can often seem as if it hailed from Speyside, but this one surely goes out like a robust Highlander. Barley sugars, indistinct vegetal notes, citric minerality, and plenty of power for the standard ABV."
2122,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"HonestHalfway between Dundee and Aberdeen you’ll find the village Brechin, where the Glencadam Distillery was founded in 1825 (near the closed North Port-Brechin distillery, by the way). In 2003 the distillery was taken over by Angus Dundee Distillers PLC (who also own Tomintoul) that – besides bulk delivery to Ballantine’s and Stewart’s Cream of the Barely – really put this gentle Highlander on the map as a single malt. This 15 Year Old is labelled ‘The Rather Dignified’. Soft and very accessible nose on citrus fruit, vanilla, freshly cut grass with a hint of coconut, mint and green grapes.Very creamy on the palate with an immediate big pepperiness. Then a truckload of sweet and sour citrus fruit explodes on your palate. The whole is wrapped in vanilla and sweet barley sugars. A floral note shines through. Very fresh and summery.The finish is medium long on more of the same.Nothing earth shattering, but very honest for that price (around 60 EUR)."
2123,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"bought as it was ralfy whisky of the year for 2018. this is the kind of ""lowland style highland"" that he likes, similar to some balblairs. I like 'em too. my palate needs warming up before this but then it's really nice. 7-/10soft fresh pear and apple, gentle vanillins and oak spices giving a hint of the age. an subtle nose that works but doesn't wow.sweet and sour, medium bodied, and showing its maturity. malty sweetness intertwined with a green note and acidity - more on the acetic side than citrus. orange juice, some salted roasted nuts, indeed this one is bit 'maritime' as well. edit: as it's opening up more, the profile is more sweet forward, with barley sugar and swizzels refresher chews (a type of candy). nice!medium with the fruits from the nose and a good bit of oak."
2124,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"He wouldn’t call him Molt for every day, because the taste and aftertaste here is simply acidic and aggressive, but that’s interesting.Freshly cut green grass, then goes into hay, fresh bright citruses, lime, lemon, sour orange, white grapes, barrel.Sour bomb, lemon, lime, zest bitter, sour dry white wine, malt notes.Long and warming, slightly astringent, malt, haymaking, white grapes."

2126,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"Not as good as Deanston 12, but has some interesting bitterness on aftertaste"
2127,Glencadam 15-year-old  The Rather Dignified,"On the nose, a bit floral, apples, honey and toffee.Taste wise: honey, vanilla and fruits. Sour and sweet. Then barley sugars, a bit of citrus, peach marmalade and some spices, like cinnamon.The finish is quite sweet, quite long with some linguering honey"
2128,Glencadam 18-year-old,"Precisely crafted, immaculately constructed, but sadly also way overpriced. For that money, I'd rather get the 21-year-old. Or two bottles of the 15-year-old. Or two bottles of the 13-year-old ""Reawakening"". You get the idea."

2135,Glencadam 18-year-old,"Straightforward, quite simple malt that doesn't really do anything wrong but also doesn't seem completely convincing. More like ""easy drinking"" for which it is a bit too expensive.There is a slight lactic acid impression at the beginning. Vanilla, cooked pears and apples bring fruit and sweetness with them. But that also seems a bit sour. There is also a refreshing note of menthol with fresh lemon.Creamy, soft, slightly tingling and spicy, Vanilla and fruit are there, along with lemons and a little honey. It also has a slightly floral effect on the palate. Grain and fresh hay make it a little drier.Short finish, vanilla, fruit sweetness, and he's gone ..."
2136,Glencadam 18-year-old,"A moment for aeration is absolutely necessary for its values to open up more. Without it, whisky is not very encouraging for me. A drop of water makes a much better impression. The bitterness goes away, there is a sugar-like sweetness, and the fruitiness increases. The finish is just chocolate without any pepper notes.

2138,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,"[February, 2017]  This review is on the first batch released - I bought this bottle for 75 Euro in September 2014.Really nice stuff to drink...  Given its complexity and balance I think they added quite some casks much older than 21 years to this batch.  It has a very nice barley sweetness and a lovely flavour's depth mostly on fruity and flowery notes.  The finish is considerably long, mouth-coating and not drying out.  All in all a very nice dram, one I could sip several an evening without getting bored about it...Well done, Glencadam and welcome back to the whisky scene!"
2139,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,"From a PLV perspective, we don't have to talk for long. A must. It is a rock solid malt without missing notes that delivers what it should. Only the ""alleged"" sherry story is a bit neglected? There's nothing on the bottle either. As Ralfy always says: The label is the contract;) ... well, no sherry and ... he needs water!Fine lemon pudding with sweet vanilla. The bourbon barrel provides grassy wood notes. Everything feels soft and integrated. The flowery nose does exactly what the label promises. You just have to imagine the sherry. I didn't see him. A rock solid bourbon nose. Fine.The texture is creamy, buttery, sour and sweet. Even tropical fruits shimmer through and the oak-flavored tannins dance on the tongue. 21 years are noticeable. That's how it should be. Vanilla and pineapple are added in the transition. Very oily with a sour citrus freshness. Floral with berries on pepper bread give a dry mouth feel with all kinds of spices.Medium to long, buttery soft but drying. Peppery and spicy and there for a long time. Lasting spiciness and warming. A great 21 with no compromises for the money of an 18. House whisky."
2140,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,"Too thin for 21 years, too superficial, too arbitrary compared to the 10 year old (!) - very disappointing in comparison"
2141,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,"Extremely aromatic, fragrant and flowery. Linden flowers but also linden blossom honey, fully ripe waxed tires, some ginger and in the background earthy and mineral. Later powdered sugar, oranges, some cinnamon, vanilla and light winegums.Oily onset Aromatic onset with beautiful rooty ginger, gentian ?, floral notes of chamomile, lime blossom, mint and herb rich hay and waxy and nutty notes.Long, tart oak and waxy notes and mint."
2142,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,"Very well balanced whisky. Nicely made. Really enjoyable.Mature, dusty first appearence. The smell of hot sand at the sea. Then ripe pears as well as some exotic fruits. Honey coated papaya. Smooth start. Initially sweet and creamy. Then becoming more powerful with quite some oak suddenly kicking in. Really harmoniously integrated tannins. Definitely sherry influenced. The memories of eating Banana Flambé with vanilla ice cream coming back to my mind. Malty dry finish. Quite long. Milk chocolate with hazelnuts lingering on."
2143,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,"Orange skin, mandarins, spice, anise, fudge, mango. The taste is spicy, cloves, ginger, wet roses, dairy butter, orange, almond, cacao, dark chocolate and ends dry."
2144,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,Based on 2021 release - Glencadam has potential but the 21y old is really not worth its price - nice nose but too woody in the finish - prefer the 15y much more and even 10y so do not go for this one.
2145,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,
2146,Glencadam 21-year-old  The Exceptional,"Pleasant floral and crispy fresh aroma. An rather unusual palette, with some acidity and sweetness which creates an unbalanced flavor profile.

2148,Glendronach 08-year-old The Hielan',"With its combination of ex-bourbon and sherry casks, The Hielan' offers a nice twist to the GlenDronach theme. Thumbs up for the age statement! On the nose, fresh fruits, butterscotch and beeswax are interwoven with vanilla, cinnamon and hints of thyme. Punchy, crisp and spirit-driven, the palate takes over with citrus-honey, pepper and a touch of arugula. A gentle hug from the casks appears towards the finish, leaving behind a nutty/grassy aftertaste. Although I do prefer the sherry monsters, this young malt qualifies for a perfect everyday dram.RATING: 3.7/5.0 stars ≙ 85 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE [+]"
2149,Glendronach 08-year-old The Hielan',"Tastes and feels young, and isn't in my opinion totally ready, but I prefer this to Glenfarclas of similar age, since this one is fattier, rounder and less grassy to me. Thanks to member Waykid for the sample!Some yeast in water and a fattiness that helps round it. Some smoke of a dry, kiln-like style, and a medium sherry touch, much lighter than I thought it would have, but then again when I think back on the CS releases versus the single casks my expectations were wrong. There is some sawdust and a dry, spicy note. Yeast, sawdust, spices... sure this isn't Wolfburn?The softness of the body surprises me. Sure, it's 46 %, but a young whisky from 2010s that's neither sharply boozy nor watery, or overly yeasty? I'm impressed. Marabou chocolate, something coppery, some highland peat, and sugar. It could stand to have a more definite profile, but then on the other hand it doesn't have any overdone finish either, which is a plus.Short, sweet, oily, and sugary."
2150,Glendronach 08-year-old The Hielan',"While not a real stunner of a whisky and not typically GlenDronach, it for sure is a really enjoyable one! It shows some youth on the palate and lacks complexity but what do you expect from an 8 year old? Furthermore I couldn't detect any off-notes. I have to add that this could have been any other non-peated Speysider/Highlander as I could not blindly tell you this was a GlenDronach. Last but not least. The big 'AGED 8 YEARS' statement, that's something not many distilleries would do. Anything under 10 years receives a dodgy name in 99 out of 100 cases. Just a little detail but I think it shows some balls. All in all, well done GlenDronach. I just happen to like your extremely sherried stuff a little more!To start, this is vastly different compared to 100% sherry matured Glendro. Sherry is still noticeable but it is mostly fresh fruit that dominates the nose. Apple, lemon, kiwi, pineapple, plum, malt, vanilla, aniseed, custard, rice pudding, ginger, caramel, dark chocolate, praline, leather, almond, marzipan, dry hay, lamb chops and a little solvent note, probably just the alcohol showing a little youth. Not exactly what I'm looking for in a GlenDronach, but on its own a quite refreshing nose.It follows the nose, being a little sour on the arrival. Malt, apple juice, grapefruit, orange zest, raisins, green grapes, creme brulee, Oloroso sherry, chocolate sauce, salted caramel, roasted almond, olive bread, vanilla, honey, sultana, lavender and butterscotch. Very fruity again, lightly sherried and with enough space left over to show its distillate character. Drinks really easy.Medium with vanilla, malt and milk chocolate."

This is followed by milk chocolate, vanilla and butter.Rather full and creamy. Apples, oranges and some spices(cumin, ginger). A strange sensation of sweet and sour candy, and a metallic note. There's some coffee too.Vanilla cream and pecheas followed by some marzipan (love that!). Some fresh herbs and a hint of smoke linger"
2154,Glendronach 08-year-old The Hielan',"Not too bad, actually, especially of you try it blind and your preconceptions of what a Dronach should be like are taken away. The 46% abv. suit it well. Good for what it is, but of course nowhere near a sherry bomb."

On the nose, there is a nice interplay of intense sweetness and fruity acidity with pears, melons and hints of eucalyptus.

2173,Glendronach 15-year-old Revival,"A different beast altogether from its earlier incarnation, and one that by all rights should have gone by another name. A revival of the Revival? Not really. A good contemporary sherried whisky with an age statement and a characterful distillate? Certainly.PX and American oak up front, along with a slight sense of heat (or, if you're more positively inclined, warmth) and some rather fresh-seeming wood - and the spices that brings: ginger, nutmeg, some soft cinnamon. So yeah: raisins, dates, chewy toffee, and all that, but also a real sense of the distillate coming through, perhaps more so than in the older version. Less integrated, obviously younger, more spirit-driven, more shaped by quercus alba. Of course all that was to be expected, and it's a shame that pretty much all of us who taste and discuss this feel they have to point out differences to the ""original"", simply because the owners apparently believed they had to piggyback on that bottling's stellar reputation. If this had been brought out under a different name, its own merits would've been more apparent. It's pleasant and substantial, after all, with some hefty sherry and meaty, weighty distillate playing in tandem. Also, with some time in the glass, some lovely savory umami notes appear, with some liquorice, and somewhat surprisingly - a floral / citric aspect. Definitely nothing to sneer at, but of course it pales in comparison with its predecessor. Edit: gets better and better after some time in the open bottle; I've upped the score by two points.As with the nose, a lot of PX and youthful American oak at first, with a peppery, gingery bite to it. Then more sweetness and red fruits come in, followed by leather, soy sauce, charcoal, and pretty pronounced wood spices. As Serge would say: very modern. It's good though, and as with the CS versions, I like that we can actually get more of an impression of the distillery character when the (fresh / first-fill) sherry is less pronounced. Nothing to sit and marvel at, but a very good drinker around the 50-60 € mark.Warming for sure, with sweet, pickled ginger, crema di balsamico, and sticky-sweet dried dates. Some residual heat. Pleasant, but no real charm of its own. It's the palate on repeat, pretty much."

Soft woody spice notes in the background.If the wood now cuts through, then it tends to be in the bitter direction. Too bad. But the creamy sherry effect comes quickly. Now orange caramel in plum jam. It is full-bodied and wonderfully oily. But ... something bothers me on the bitter side.

2188,Glendronach 21-year-old Parliament,"The PLV at this point is impressive. Nice age with a balanced sherry barrel ratio. However, I prefer the younger two 15/18 at Glendronach. It's a matter of taste. You can also feel that the 15 and 18 belong together. Parliament is very special.Extremely full and thick on the nose. Oak wood and sherry sugar. Milk chocolate toffee with leathery vanilla. You smell so much, it takes all to find. Impressive.It fills the mouth with a full and full flavor. Bittersweet but not disturbing, it delivers everything that goes with it. Fruits like plums, currants and blackberries, everything is there. Coffee beans pickled in red wine. Heavy thick toffee syrup. Big and woody. Too much of a good thing for me at this point.Medium to long with lots of wood and sherry. Somewhat bitter and spicy, more peppery with cocoa and tobacco. It stays creamy with ripe fruits until the end, But overall, the oak that is getting heavier and heavier bothers me personally. You have to like that. Not for everyone."
2189,Glendronach 21-year-old Parliament,"The nose was incredible, the finish was lovely but the palate was too dry and bitter for my liking. The flavours themself? Top stuff, such a shame that a minor aspect takes away some of the enjoyment. The 18 Allardice on the other hand keeps that juicy sensation I'm looking for.Sweet and smoky, it has that typical GlenDronach nose and just smells like it has spent some time in a dark basement. Thick Oloroso sherry, roasted coffee beans, leather, old books, musty basement, dark chocolate, stroopwafel, orange peel, warm apple pie, raisins, apricot, caramel, toffee, smoke, nutmeg, hazelnut, cereal, oak, licorice and menthol. Fantastic nose, just like its 15 and 18 year old brothers. There's just so much going on, every sniff brings something else to mind.Dense and oily mouthfeel, a wide arrange of flavours just like the nose. The sweeter PX sherry is a lot more present here. Turns rather dry and bitter soon after. Oak, spice, chocolate orange cakes, raisins, banana, apple cider, raspberries, salted caramel, wet tobacco, malt, vanilla, walnut, madeira wine, glazed ham, cherries and a smoky note supporting the rest of the flavours all the way. As expected, the palate continues to deliver an equally wide spectrum of flavours. I'm not that fond of how dry and bitter it is on the palate though. At some moments I recognized a bourbony character hiding in the background, which was weird but surprising.Long finish for a sherried malt. Dark fruits riding on a wave of subtle smokiness."
2190,Glendronach 21-year-old Parliament,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deFull-bodied, intense and elegant. A luscious potpourri of red and ripe fruits (cherries, blackberries & blueberries) is making its way out of my jar. Behind the massive sherry influence hides a variety of flavors, which gradually crystallize during nosing. Juicy oranges, sweet apricots, grapefruit, raisins and a burnt caramel crust of a crème brûlée I perceive. Heavy spices with plenty of oak, roasted almonds, dark chocolate, leather, cinnamon, walnuts and gingerbread are rapidly gaining presence. The nose is very complex and harmonious - just wonderful.Almost syrupy, the GlenDronach wets the entire oral cavity. A pleasant sweetness runs down the cheeks, while on the tip of the tongue a subtle Pfeffrigkeit sets in and causes a slight tingle. The alcohol content (48%) is very well integrated and always gives the malt sufficient strength. The whisky starts very intense, sweet-spicy and with a subtle bitterness. Although the various sensory impressions usually contrast relatively strongly with each other, in this case they merge into a harmonious symbiosis. The red and ripe fruits are very present and form the sherrylastige foundation. Plentiful caramel, dark chocolate, coffee, leather, nuts, spices (cinnamon), dry tobacco leaves, gingerbread and oak immediately follow. The complexity to be anticipated during nosing continues seamlessly in terms of taste.Long, warm and spicy. At the beginning of the finish a slight pepperiness flashes for the last time before the heavy aromas, such as leather, dark chocolate, walnuts, spices and a decent dose of oak, take over the flavor of the upper hand and let the malt calmly end. The palate creates a subtle dryness and a noticeable bitterness."
2191,Glendronach 21-year-old Parliament,"For whatever reason, I put the tasting in front of me for a long time. The more beautiful the consistently positive surprise. Very nice ""standard"".Balanced sherry flavors, very fine and balanced. A lot of dark fruit, cooked. Pleasant wood flavors. Plum compote. Light caramel sugar. Overall, great compositionWow. That almost says everything. One would like to enjoy only what is offered as a whole, without having to worry much about details. Nevertheless, here too rich fruit blend, sherry full, first-class balanced, makes you want more. The 48% Vol. Are the malt well to face.Very good, long-lasting, pleasant finish, slight bitterness with beautiful woody aromas."
2192,Glendronach 21-year-old Parliament,"Almost amazing. Lovely rich, deep and sweet with aromas and nuances I absolutely love. Then again, balance is perhaps not high on today’s menu. I found that my initial nosing and tasting were just fantastic – deep, opulent sherry with almost a confident swagger. But, once my palate had settled into the dram, I struggled to find deeper complexity, and the naturally high level of astringency of the liquid reduced my sense that this was a luxuriant experience and more of a constant sherry-punch in the face. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder though, and there’s more than enough here to enjoy that I can certainly understand why some colleagues rave about this Glendronach.Full tasting notes: https://www.thedramble.com/tastings/glendronach/glendronach-21-year-old-parliament/"

2194,Glendronach 21-year-old Parliament,"It's either the heavy sherry influence or the fact that it has been produced with significantly older stock for some time: this sure seems older than its - already considerable - stated age. 21 going on 25, at least as far as my bottle (ca. 2016) is concerned. What we have here is a heavy, massive, sweet-and-dry sherry-soaked, oily and woody nose. Chocolate-covered, rum-soaked raisins; bacon-wrapped, roasted figs; aged aceto balsamico; blackberry and/or plum jam; mulled wine, speculoos and christmas spices; assorted nuts. In terms of sherry maturation, this is definitely more on the fruity-and-juicy than on the earthy-and-leathery side. Having said that, there is some leather to be found, along with other aromas that exude the aura of age: musty cellar, dusty attic, shopworn library books... Zero alcohol on the nose despite the elevated ABV, but it's also not exactly easy to locate the distillery character behind this wall of deep and dark sherry aromas. So this is the one quibble I have with this otherwise pretty perfect nose - the PX is perhaps just a tiny bit too prominent. But enough grousing; on to the palate!Without water, there's an immediately leathery, nutty and (given the unmistakable PX influence on the nose:) surprisingly dry attack, with an incredibly rich and mouth-coating texture. Then the juicy sweetness and the robust Glendronach Highland character hit home. There's a sense of peppery heat, but it's nowhere near as pronounced as in the 18-year-old Allardice. The burn (if you can even call it that) here is much more restrained, and, given the sticky, syrupy aspect of the palate, even welcome. Finally, some bitter notes (black liquorice, black coffee, dark chocolate) join in, along with a faint mintiness. Intense and thick throughout, without ever losing steam.Finishes strong and substantial, with a warming afterglow, then continues to stick to the insides of the mouth for a good long while, with the typical Oloroso notes of liquorice and leather as the last notes to fade. Clearly a high-class sherry monster, with the superb Glendronach distillate struggling, but not outright failing to assert itself. What I found most surprising about this one was that the wood was most discernible on the nose. On the palate and in the finish, it almost slipped my attention - either because the sherry overpowered it or because it merged with the sherry so harmoniously (depends on your perspective, I guess). So yeah: a bit brutal and crass, but also just simply a blast. An event of a whisky.P.S. Water brings out (even) more umami aromas, adds an intriguing floral element, sweetens the attack, eliminates any burn and reinforces the wood in the finish. Obviously I recommend adding some."

Nose: who cares if it’s the cask that did all the work? This is pretty magnificent, surprisingly smooth (ha, smooth!) and laden with notes of old polished wood, pipe tobacco, cedar wood, Seville oranges and then wet rocks and gravel. It’s got a slight cognacqy side, with touches of ripe peaches and maybe a little rancio. Pure loveliness and no ‘excesses’. With water: once again, more medicinal notes – beautiful ones. Natural camphor, turpentine, tincture of iodine… Then more fresh almonds.  Mouth (neat): high extraction and high power, which makes it a little difficult and Stroh-ish (do you know Austria’s Stroh 80? Quite an adventure ;-)) With water: much in line with the nose, highly herbal and medicinal. Some kind of complex albeit quite bitter cough syrup. Finish: long, all on the same notes even if quite unexpectedly, the aftertaste is rather rounder and sweeter. Yes, Chartreuse-y. Comments: you could think they have used pinewood for this. A very unusual, big and, as they say, captivating dram. SGP:571 - 87 points.whiskyfun.com"

(It exists, caramel liquor?) We have a return of the fruits but now in the background, subtly integrated with more freshness. The palate is rich, sweet, oily and the finish is enveloping and long on the fruit.  Enthusiasm 4/5"

This Glendullan was bottled at 62.6% ABV, which makes my eyebrows shoot upward. Where is my water? This release has become quite unaffordable, some 350 to even 500 EUR. Yes, those Rare Malts are living up to their name and you’ll need deep pockets to get hold of them now.Oh, FFS! What and excellent old school nose on greengages, pineapple, litchi and banana. There is also a dusty element, as if I’m in the attic. Old books or fresh saw dust. Jelly beans in the back. I’m a fan.You can almost chew this whisky, what a body. And despite the high ABV I do not gasp for breath, nor feel inclined to add water. This is an intense, full, fruity malt that also offers some plums and caramel, but excels in offering a fine balance between the very fruity notes on the one hand and the tannins from the oak cask on the other.The finish is wonderfully long and I feel bliss.In short: the best Glendullan ever. Period. Thx, Manny."

That is why I decided to do a comparison of this 1974 Glendullan Rare Malt (aged 23 years) versus the 1978 Glendullan Rare Malt edition (aged 26 years, WB id 464) tonight......and yes, this was very insightful again. Both drams offer the adorable old Highland style that is hard to find these days (because of the modern zeitgeist of extreme wood impacts and heavy wine finishes). While the Glendullan distillery character stays consistent the 1974 shows a more complex and layered profile than the 1978 which is more simple and straight forward. I certainly prefer the 1974 (if I have the choice) but the 1978 is a fine and very quaffable dram too.The colour of the 1974 is deep gold while the 1978 is two shades paler at old gold. The nose of the 1974 is not punchy at all despite its 63,1% abv and offers a classical old Highland profile with honeys, waxes, floral notes and earthy aromas (forest floor with pine needles). it is delicate and balanced and grows stronger upon breathing adding barley sugars and spices. The 1978 is rather shy and closed first (not punchy too at 56,6% abv). After some breathing it opens up nicely and shows a comparable profile to the 1974 with some more sweet fruits and honeys but without the earthy notes. The differences are marginal, so the distillery profile (distilling regime) did not change between 1974 and 1978. To me this is a clear draw.The 1974's taste is very old-stylish with lots of waxes, resin, oils and later barley sugars, autumn floral notes (haystacks), chalk and spices. All nicely balanced and layered without any flaw or off-note. The taste of the 1978 is of a comparable profile but a little more simple and not that layered. It shows more barley sugars and lacks the floral flavours, chalk and resinous notes. Nonetheless it is very interesting to explore and quaffable, provided you like the old Highland style. I prefer the 1974 on this dimension.The initial mouthfeel of the 1974 is hot first, than nicely warming and greatly coats all of the mouth without distracting moments. The 1978 arrives smoother on the palate without the initial hot impression and is comparable warming and coating, so another draw here. Both own a finish of medium length where the 1974 adds more sweeter flavours (honeys and shy fruits) without any distracting moments again. The 1978 adds no new impressions and shows no distracting moments either. I clearly like the 1974 better here. Both drams open up nicely on water and get much more approachable on the palate. Actually, I like them both neat and reduced with the 1974 preferable at 48% abv and the 1978 at 43% abv. I suggest to explore these drams neat first and then play a little with water to find the best reduction level that suits you. Both drams are excellent swimmer, for sure."
2244,Glendullan 1974  Rare Malts Selection,"Very similar profile as the Glendullan RM from 1978.

2249,Glendullan 1974  Rare Malts Selection,"with water: the smell of alcohol in the nose is almost stronger, in addition to a significantly stronger honey sweetness, the malty aromas are somewhat pushed into the background. For the ""wet dog"" comes back to the fore, so wet coat, and a very subtle sweat odor, in the mouth it is much more pleasant with water, well-balanced sweetness as a counterpoint to oak and the floral-looking malt flavors  Conclusion: Liquid history in the glass, and the confirmation of the realization that in the past really not everything was better. Yes, that's a great malt, but also not a whisky that you want to nuzzle for hours. Personally I like the cereal notes in Glen Moray, for example, much better than here, plus the slight lack of sweat, which has been shown when opening the bottle and is now easy to recognize when adding water. Nevertheless, one notices him the long maturity, he just works with water around and complex, something you will find again in the new ""designed"" whisky of today only very rarely. If you have a bottle and want to try the whisky, you should uncork the bottle a few weeks before and let the whisky breathe for a long time - 86 pointswhen opening the bottle a regular's table brother said: Wet dog. Now that the bottle has been open for a good three months and the whisky has been able to breathe properly, this ""wet dog"" can only be interpreted as an indication. Especially malted cereal notes are leading, plus some vanilla and coconut flakes, fruity and very ripe pineapple, lemon and orange peel charred oak, some honey and many floral aromas of fresh flowers (geraniums), also hay and grassy aromas join. The alcohol is present and not perfectly integrated, but brings in some white peppersweet, slightly roasted malt. floral-fruity with oak spice, the alcohol gives a very strong punch, which desperately needs waterlong and intense, here too, the grain / malt note is very clear, plus an interesting sweetness, the direction nougat / hazelnuts goes.

2256,Glendullan 1978  Rare Malts Selection,"Serge says;Glendullan 26 yo 1978/2005 (56.6%, Rare Malts)  From the final batch of the Rare Malts series. Colour: straw. Nose: as hot but grainier and maybe simpler at first nosing… But it’s soon to adopt more or less the same profile. Mashed potatoes and porridge, boiled cereals, fresh butter, fresh herbs (chive, watercress). It gets then fruitier than the Scott, on peaches… Some rather bold notes of mint tea, verbena, a little bergamot… Certainly cleaner, although there are some meaty notes as well. Mouth: it’s very different this time, much more explosive, with a ‘punchy’ mix of liquorice and fruits (ripe apricots and melons). Hot caramel, grains, maybe a little lavender crème and something pleasantly prickly (icing sugar, pear drops). Let’s add a little water now (… while the nose gets a little farmier as usual, but also mintier)… Yes, it gets more drinkable, more playful (lots of acidic fruits like lemons, fresh pineapples, apricots, kiwis) and sweeter and more rounded, as expected (light caramel and honey). It’s good and the finish is rather long, sweet and bitter in a nice way, with something waxy in the background. Probably not a total winner but certainly one of the very best Glendullans I ever had. Not ‘dull’ at all!  88 points."
2257,Glendullan 1978  Rare Malts Selection,"Finally something of format. Nose: No frills combination of malt, polished wood, wax, straw, dry hay, and soot from candles. Then star fruit and orange peel. With water: green gooseberry, some green banana. Soot, dirty bike chain. Something OBF. Mouth: star fruit, malt, soot, OBF. Simple and great. Candle wax. Medium-long finish, sooty. Straight forward, did I say straightforward? Classic representative of its time."
2258,Glendullan 1978  Rare Malts Selection,"Tasting: October 2021Cooked vegetables, a sweet waxiness, citrus, vanilla but also some sulfur tones. Floral and with some spices in the background. The nose does not require any water, as the alcohol is well balanced.A strong citrus directly with a little pepper and a hidden, weak smoke that is very pleasant. Oily, waxy and with some creamy notes. With water, a floral perfume appears. Light sulfur and a pleasant chemical sweetness. The smoke has become even more subdued.Medium to long with citrus and spices. An amazing floral sensation with honey and oak wood."

Ok it's not a stellar dram, but I think there is more than enough fun to be had to merit a very good score. Intensely malty like a malt barn with open tins of beer-kit malt concentrate lying around. Then lots of fruit with berries and compote. Very nice. Water doesn't suppress the malt, but it brings more fruit, which with another drop softens into fruit pie loaded with cinnamon. Very sweet and sugary up front, but as it develops there's fruit bursting out of every drop. Water opens it and gives the fruit more room to manoeuvre and yet more freshens it and makes it very delicious.At full strength the finish is suppressed a little, but the lingering sugary heat doesn't quite hide the boiled fruit sweet moments. Water sets it fizzing and and just keeps getting longer."

It is as if they have mixed many barrels and have blended all the characteristics of the barrels. For me this is the textbook example of mass production.

The fruitiness is more dominant, with notes of tanned leather. The taste, also much better. Delicate, more floral and fruity, more honey, less oak, milk chocolate. Completely different finish: sweet, honey, vanilla cheesecake with raisins, bitterness gave way to orange in syrup with a nice touch of warm finish. To sum up ....

2348,Glenfarclas 15-year-old  New Label,"The marketing doesn’t lie… it really is beautifully balanced. On the nose, the interplay between cask and distillate, sherry and whisky is very much to my liking. It’s light, sweet, fruity, woody but not overtly so. There’s your usual sherry notes - raisins, sweet white grapes, fudge, walnuts, hint of raspberry. The nose also has a solventy edge from the spirit which I enjoy a lot. The oak is elegant and well integrated. There’s also an aromatic top note that gives the nose lift and brightness - I’d say a mixture citrus oils, with bergamot being dominant for me, with a hint of something like lemon balm or mint. Highly enjoyable!On the palate, the arrival is dominated by sweet and juicy sherry, with raisins, nuts and again citrus (orange). Then I get hit with a blast of spices from the cask, some black pepper. Sadly, the finish is where this whisky lets us down - it’s pretty nothingy. After the spices, we get some remnants of raisins and dates but mostly just a general alcohol sensation with not a lot of flavour. Reminds me of most Diageo standard releases.Glenfarclas show some serious mastery here with the balance of the whisky - too bad the overall experience is let down by them cutting some corners on quality, resulting in this whisky ultimately feeling quite ‘mass-produced’. I shall pour the dregs of a bottle of Glen Scotia 15 into this Glenfarclas to give it a bit more body."

This one has seen a cask maturation policy that promotes/utilises the additional desirable sherry elements whilst allowing the spirit to shine. Furthermore, there’s a nice balance between youth and maturity here: tradition < modernisation if you will. That contemporary bottling strength hasn’t gone unnoticed either.T: A mix of oloroso and PX I’d say, yet with no obtrusive cask management ‘tricksiness’. It’s the barley spirit that shines through, a squidgy floury fluffiness,…F: ,… into [grassy] confectionary notes to barley sugar.

2355,Glenfarclas 15-year-old  New Label,"I'm rather underwhelmed by this offering, knowing Glenfarclas' reputation for quality sherried single malts. There are a few off-notes in this bottling that suggest perhaps some casks were sulphur spoiled. The nose and the initial flavours in the mouth are very pleasant and belies this more acrid note. I may have simply got a bad batch, and the general flavour palate is enough to make me want to try more from this distillery, but I can't help being disappointed in this particular bottling.Honey, light sweet spices like cinnamon. Clean sherried profile, wood influence strong but not overpowering. Nice malty, biscuity note.Stronger than the nose suggests. Very woody, peppery, spicy and unfortunately quite bitter (?Sulphur?)

2358,Glenfarclas 17-year-old  New Label,"[March, 2021] After many very old, complex and (of course) excellent drams over the course of the last days I am in the mood for a rather simple and young drink tonight - so why not a standard 'farclas edition......and it was sub-standard quality spirit they filled into these casks 17 years ago, and in former times such casks would have been used for blending purposes only. But thanks (?!?) to the whisky boom almost all Glenfarclas casks are needed to feed the growing thirst of the growing single malt consumer base which results in - guess what: Lower quality releases, what else?The colour is burnished and the nose offers an unspectacular but very okay-ish profile with sherry, malt and wood in balance. There are neither off-notes nor highlights to detect - this is the trademark nose of an every-day's dram (and exactly this is what the 17-years Glenfarclas aims for).The taste is about the same with average sherry and malt flavours in a bitter-drying wooden setting. This is not pleasing to my taste buds, but it is not really bad either. What else to say? Nothing.The dram arrives light on the palate with neither a significant warming nor coating effect, this is a weak mouthfeel to be honest. Accordingly, the finish is short as a lightning leaving just some bitter-drying impressions (plastics) which are quite annoying. Water is not needed, it just flattens everything."

2368,Glenfarclas 18-year-old  New Label,"A soft, sweet fruity malt with hints of milk chocolate, some oak and slightly nutty notes. It was probably created to a high degree from refill sherry barrels. These were probably not only European, but also American oak. The 1000ml bottle lasted a long time with me and the more oxygen in the bottle, the more intense he became. Also in the glass you should give him at least 15 minutes to breathe. Since I have had worse 18 year old in the glass and the whole thing at a great value for money."
2369,Glenfarclas 18-year-old  New Label,"[January, 2019] Just a quick review of a free sample so I do not know what batch (year) this was drawn from......and this is very bad, both that I do not know the exact batch and the dram itself. It is composed mainly of exhausted (leached) casks that contributed almost nothing to the maturation. Hence this whisky smells and tastes more of a new make spirit than a malt at all. Hey, why do you bottle such immature stuff? Re-cask it and let it mature for another ten years, at least! Shame on you...The colour is pale gold and the nose offers an unimpressive and immature profile, quite unusual for an 18-years old. It smells as if they used a large number of inactive (exhausted) casks in this batch - I can get more aromas that come typically with new make spirits than with seasoned malts. In a blind setting I would have guessed a 3-5 years old non-scottish ""wanna-be"" whisky.The taste confirms this guess with a very simple barley sugary profile and some shy spices. This is one-dimensional and boring, I prefer any blend over such a malt. Water dilutes the anyhow thin nose and taste further, I neither like this dram neat nor reduced.The spirit arrives with almost no mouthfeel on the palate (neither good nor bad). The finish is rather short and turns a little bitter-tannic towards the end. I am glad it was a 3cl sample only..."
2370,Glenfarclas 18-year-old  New Label,"I have read several rather negative reviews relating to the Glenfarclas 18 year old. Especially taking into account the price for this 18 year old whisky I do not agree to this negativity.Not very intense, but very aromatic. Direct nosing of the whisky provides a not very intense but pleasant smell. Interestingly, the entire room gets filled with the aromatic smell of this whisky:- Honey - Dried fruits (raisins) - Banana and ripe apples - A bit of sherryThe taste is rather intense and very pleasant. Still a bit sharp for an 18 year old whisky, but that does not make the whisky less tasty (smell and taste are quite alike):- A lot of honey- Dried fruit (raisins)- Cinnamon - Light sherry- Ripe apples The taste can be compared to a warm home-baked apple pie filled with a bit of sherry.The finish is long, warm and sweet."

It shows some nice depth and complexity, especially in the initial taste. It definitely benefits from adding some water. It's cosmetical and pharmaceutical notes are quite odd and a little disturbing at first, but fade as the filling level decreases and eventually integrate very well and only add to the complexity.

2375,Glenfarclas 18-year-old  New Label,One of the best value malts currently available in my view.
2376,Glenfarclas 18-year-old  New Label,"When I first opened the bottle, I quickly noticed that its taste was a bit locked. To pour it into a glass and wait for a while, his fragrance can fully bloom. The irritation of alcohol is still a bit strong. It seems that it should be stored in very old oak barrels, which makes the taste not as soft as the average 18-year-old whisky. Based on his current state two months after opening the bottle, I gave him 83 points, but I hope he will get better and better with time. After all, he is an 18-year-old Glenfarclas. Looking forward to it! The taste totals 83 points, and the price adds 2 points, for a total of 85 points."
2377,Glenfarclas 18-year-old  New Label,Bang for the buck though prices have climbed already from sub 50 EUR to 60+. Less sherried that the 15 but comparably similarly priced to give you a hint. There are def many better 18 yo out there and I prefer a good batch of the 15 @46% abv. or even a liter of 12 yo for half the price. Nonetheless alright for what it is. Could work well 50/50 with 105 to spice things up imho. Would not pay more than 60 EUR for it as the quality is not there and judging from the reviews there either is a significant batch variation in quality or it's decreased permanently. Tried mine in about 2015. :-)
2378,Glenfarclas 21-year-old  New Label,"When you are looking for an older, substantial Single Malt that isn't outrageously expensive, consider Glenfarclas 21. Intense fruitiness, green apples, gooseberries and hints of pineapple dominate the nose. Fresh herbs, heather honey and faint smoke of 'burned stuff' linger in the background, adding a pleasant complexity. The age of this malt shows in the taste: heavy cask influence with wood spices and tannins combines with fruits and vanilla, culminating in a lasting, nutty and slightly dry finish. A characterful and intriguing Speysider for sophisticated palates.RATING: 4.0/5.0 stars ≙ 88 pts → FIRST-CLASS"
2379,Glenfarclas 21-year-old  New Label,"The 21-year-old Glenfarclas is available for a good price and that of course makes you curious whether this whisky is a real price / performance hit, or whether, despite the low price for 21 years of aging in sherry barrels, the whisky is not in his Home bar needs. It is amber-colored in the glass ... a whole lot lighter than 18-year-old Glendronach Allardice, who I had in the glass yesterday. I immediately have a wonderful fruitiness on the nose. But not the cooked, dark fruits and plum jam with a very heavy sweetness from very active sherry casks, but rather a fresh fruitiness with red berries, sweet apples, orange and lemon peel. During the longer smelling, I have a touch of peach and pineapple, the apples are now drizzled with a little honey. The fruitiness is closely interwoven with a spiciness with pepper and a little cinnamon. Dark nut chocolate is now noticeable in the background and the wood of the oak barrels is getting stronger and stronger. Overall, a very pleasant load of aromas, the whisky is pleasantly soft and harmonious on the nose. The Glenfarclas is very tasty in the mouth, a little pepper and a very slight ginger spiciness can be felt on the tongue but otherwise the whisky caresses the mouth ... soft, soft and a little too watery for my taste. The slight spiciness on the tongue feigns power, but the intensity of the aromas and the volume are simply missing compared to whiskys with a higher alcohol content. I also have the fruits of smelling in my mouth, but this time less sweet and less distinct, but sprinkled with pepper and a touch of cinnamon. The spiciness is more dominant than on the nose, the nut chocolate fades towards walnuts and coffee, a little bit of leather and tobacco are noticeable. The tannins get stronger and stronger, but after 21 years in oak barrels that's a good thing, otherwise you'd better grab a 12 year old whisky. Everything stays harmonious and soft in the mouth ... very pleasant, but somehow not really exciting either. The finish is just about medium long with a little grapefruit, the aftertaste of sweet apples and a little cocoa powder. The tannins with slight influences of leather, tobacco and oak overlay the other flavors. A little too lax for my taste. Overall, this is a really easy whisky to drink. I could imagine this wonderfully on a summer evening with friends. It has rather light, fresh aromas and no oppressive, heavy fruit sweetness. And yet it also has a spiciness and tannins, all of which are well integrated. This whisky is sure to please people who have nothing to do with whisky. Dangerously tasty! But: this is not a highlight for the discerning whisky drinker. There is a lack of intensity, abundance, rough edges ... this bottle was definitely not a bad buy! On the contrary, I think the whisky is really good for the price and I even like it better than the 25-year-old brother. A whisky that I like to have on hand for cozy summer evenings with family or friends. I got 86/100 points."
2380,Glenfarclas 21-year-old  New Label,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deA mature and elegant Sherrynoten leave a first positive impression. In the direct duel of aromatic intensity, the 21-year-old Glenfarclas against the Glengoyne 21 years and the 21-year-old GlenDronach Parliament has noticeably lost the eye - without, however, stating this as a negative trait. The Glenfarclas is instead soft and mild, the different aromas need a few minutes to unfold. Ripe, red fruits, sweet sherry notes, nuts, marzipan, caramel, juicy oranges, lemon ripeness, milk chocolate, Christmas spices and striking oak wood notes crystallize. A subtle smoky note blends in perfectly with the harmonious and very balanced nose.The soft and mild impression also continues in taste: The texture of Glenfarcla is gentle and slightly oily. Elegant Sherrynoten are present immediately. Ripe, red fruits, nuts, almonds, caramel, dark forest honey and chocolate follow. The initially juicy oranges turn into grapefruit, which are slightly acidic. Christmas spices and old oak notes are always present, but never too intrusive or dominant. Hidden in the background, I perceive a slight hint of smoke again. Still very round and harmonious, a bit unspectacular.Medium long, sweet and spicy and slightly warming. Gentle sherry notes, sweet caramel, citrus fruits, nuts, chocolate and light smoke slowly fade away. The Christmas spices and the old oak notes are unmistakable and leave a slight dryness on the palate. At the finish line, Glenfarclas lacks a bit of strength."
2381,Glenfarclas 21-year-old  New Label,"Considered by the PLV, my best from Glenfarclas. The difference to the 15: the 21 is more sweet and less sherry dominates. But more vanilla and therefore it has the better character of a distillery. Personal impression !Light, sweet smoke rises and mixes the great aromas together. Dry fruits underlaid with citrus notes. Everything is included, from light sherry with nutmeg to oak and almonds. Great barrel selection! Add a touch of vanilla to it ... great. Delicious !Rich aroma fills the mouth. Very pleasant with plenty of butterscotch underlined with oak tones. Wonderfully full-bodied and round, everything slowly develops into fruity, smoky and at the same time spicy aromas.

2383,Glenfarclas 21-year-old  New Label,"If you are at the beginning of your whisky journey, stay away from Glenfarclas 21. In my humble opinion, a beginner is someone who tried less than 100 whiskies.The presence of wood dominates the nose. One can feel the age in the smell, the dungeon dumped, humid smell - it's all present. The spirit character fades, with rounded notes of apple peel, hidden hints of ananas and lime. In the background, far away hints of honey develop. Maltyness, and hey emerge with time - be patient, give it time.Slow development, it grows it rises. Bitter tannins from the wood greats your palette. Citric notes, lime, grapefruit, unripped oranges are present in the back - you need to search for it as it hides beneath the wood taste. It's round and velvety - it has a story to tell, you need time to listen.Medium finish, bitter, oaky and oily. It coats the mouth with grapefruit bitterness and slowly fades in apple peel, pear notes, vanilla, and nuttiness before disappears.

SorryImmediately upon opening, dark dried fruits in the room. So the nose is his strong point. Respect. Finely balanced sherry note with vanilla, nutmeg and mint. Buttery and creamy in the nose. Very complex. If you have the time, you can experience a lot in the nose. A dream.It starts off spicy and hot and becomes slightly bitter. That's exactly not my thing.

Initially quite dry on the palate, with blackberries and cherries. Milk chocolate and cocoa. The fruit notes continue to spread over time, becoming more intense.

It is multi-layered!Dark cherries and other sherry flavors dominate here for meIn terms of body, he cannot keep up with the 40-year-old, and maybe there should be a little more oomph for himself.

2408,Glenfarclas 40-year-old,"[August, 2017]  Tonight I am in the mood to do another of these crazy vintage head-to-head tastings, this time it is this 2nd release of a 40-years old Glenfarclas from 2010 versus the 3rd release from 2012 (WB id 52488).Both are great drams that are simply adorable and dangerously quaffable.  Around the time of their release they were quite affordable for a 40-years old and still a price point of around 500 Euro is okay given the quality of these drams.  If you can afford it go for it at auctions (but remember there are many later releases of a 40-year Glenfarclas that might be different to these)...The 2010 has a colour of mahogany and the 2012 is around one shade paler at tawny. The texture of the 2010 shows very late sticky tears and late slow legs. The 2012 shows some earlier and a little faster legs but still very late fat sticky tears. The 2012 offers a very bold and complex nose on fine herbal sherry aromas wih some spicy wooden notes. The 2010 owns less a herbal but a more sweet and fruity sherry profile that is at least as complex as the 2010. So the winner depends on your preferred profile - I like the more fruity profile of the 2010 a little better than the herbal of the 2012 but this is just a nuance.The taste of both drams are multi-layered and tackle the taste buds with an unbelievable array of different flavours. The 2012 is nicely balanced on all the sherry flavours one can imagine plus some very nice spices (even some salt) and herbs. The 2010 is a little more spicier (peppery) but more chocolatey too. Hard to decide which one is better, in case of doubt I would prefer the 2012 here (but again it is just a nuance). Some water opens the nose of the 2010 even further but flattens both the taste and finish. Same with the 2012 so nose it with some water added and drink it neat (You think, that is impossible? ...simply use two glasses).The 2010 immediately coats all of the mouth with a warming feeling, no distracting moments to mention (the tannins are just perfect for my taste). Same with the 2012 that is even a little more charming on that very first impressions (maybe it had the advantage that the 2010 already coated the mouth before). The finish is unbelievably long on both drams with no distracting bitter or drying moments. The 2010 vanishes nicely in different waves that get more and more chocolatey over time, really adorable. The 2012 gets more herbal again that is a perfect contrast to the sweet sherry aromas. Nevertheless I like the chocolatey finish of 2010 a little better."
2409,Glenfarclas 40-year-old,"More on: https://tomtrinkt.blog/Heavy aroma cargo, 40 years long storage time thank you. Plenty of juicy, overripe oranges paired with wonderfully harmonious sherry notes. After the raisins, cherries and a few blackberries, dark chocolate follows with a handful of hazelnuts and walnuts. There are always clear oak notes and some leather present.Strong appetizers, the juicy oranges and the dark fruit basket, peppered with cherries, blackberries, raisins, raspberries and a few blueberries, are immediately present. The mouthfeel is extremely creamy and oily, the alcohol content of 46 percent by volume is perfectly integrated. The fruit potpourri gives way to a soft caramel note, some forest honey and dark chocolate with a cocoa content beyond the 70% mark. Spicy oak notes with cloves, cinnamon and hints of smoke / tobacco add to the overwhelming and sheer endless complexity of various flavors. What a harmony! Great!Very long and warm. Espresso, sandalwood, toffee, marzipan, a hint of smoke and oak. The finish gradually gets drier, enveloped by a pleasant, light bitterness."

After an intense, creamy experience of dark fruits, add a wonderful red peach. Ohh man ... that nose should never end.The barrels register themselves on the tongue and tingle. Wow effect. Then the palate keeps what the nose promises. Dark fruits, wonderful oak, followed by the best leather. Everything together also results in fantastic espresso notes.

2416,Glenfarclas 40-year-old,"Sooo good. Tried the 40-year-old and the 30-year-old against each other. A clear difference. While the 30 -year-old is clearly on the fruity side, with the very old the spice and wood come to the fore much more clearly. Complex, dense and beautiful interplay between the sherry fruitiness and the spice from the woodfirst of all very spicy, the aromas from the wood actually come out superficially. The sherry notes are there too, of course, but only in second place in comparison, I have dark cherries and plums, for example, which then come out stronger and stronger.Intense, heavy body. The full sherry program: prunes, dates, dried fruits, and a lot more. But of course also spicy aromas, be it cinnamon or anise, but also tobacco, old wood.

And if a certain batch number is more delicious than the others how can I find a second bottle? This all sounds just like stupid marketing nonsense that aims to make a standard edition more sexy to collectors (but who collects Glenfiddich 18-years old bottles, anyone out there?)......and this tastes exactly as a standard edition should taste: Easy without any spikes or off-notes but without the complexity that makes the great editions so interesting. It is a good dram to serve to friends which are not into whisky yet, I guess most rookies will like it (somehow)...The colour is old gold and the nose offers a lush honey-waxy-floral profile with notes of green apples that is not bad, actually. This is truly an old style Traditional Scotch nose which is mainly spirit-driven but it is not the most complex one. Nice to take a sniff before drinking, nothing else.The taste is about the same, quite fresh on home-grown fruits, honeys, waxes and some summer floral impressions and easy drinkable, for sure. It is not really interesting in terms of flavours exploration, after some chewing a milk chocolate note joins in - that is it. But there are no off-notes or imbalances either so this is what I call ""quaffable"" when focussing on other things (like a good football match).The whisky arrives warming and a little coating on the palate with no ditracting moments. The finish is of medium length and adds some bitter notes of tobacco and green tea that are welcomed first but turn a little annpying towards the end (because the finish dries out on these notes).

I think it's well done.A beguiling nose. Like at the Christmas market. Apple Helene with light fruits, hazelnuts and a little coffee. There is some oak there, but the nose remains sweet.

2497,Glenglassaugh 12-year-old  Fine Highland Malt,"If this is ""the highland standard of the past,"" it's just great. Because: excellent and easy. Not overkill, but everything that is there is clearly presented and present in fine intensity. Extremely fine: The bright apricot fruitiness, complemented by delicate sherry flavors and pleasant oak. The nose and the taste are just good and very drinkable, the finish is a bit off in comparison. But I think that's part of the character of such a malth. Makes me a well-deserved 91 total points for this ""uncomplicated highland standard"" of the past.Pleasantly bright fruit. Juicy light grapes, some litchi compote juice, behind a very elegant older oak. Fine herbal notes. And from afar, a few fine sherry flavors along with a hint of apricot fruit. This oak flavor is extremely pleasant.Amazing fruity-spicy; including light wax. Highland Malt at its best. Hmmm. And again this fine oakiness, underlaid with the juicy grapes, spiced with a touch of coriander. Apricot, some sherry, garden herb. He drinks very well. Fruity, slightly spicy Highland enjoyment. Even the younger old people of this distillery are outstanding.Ok, the finish is now a maximum of medium. But it does not always have to be super-long. Seasoning and sherry remain, the oak as well, but never becomes dominant. There remains the fresh-happy-light memory of a spring-sunny Highland walk along the bay of Portsoy."

Does not look like much, but then way back then it was more about the liquid than the package, contrary to today. By now the whisky sat in the bottle twice as long as it slept in the cask.Round, spicy and fruity nose with lots of floral notes. First a bouquet of flowers (even close to perfume), then apricot marmalade, rye bread, cigar box, mandarins and something that reminds me of peat. A stew of fruit on the stove with vanilla and caramel.Good body, nicly oily. Immediately sweet with both a sour and salty note. Really! Dried apricots, a truckload of nuts, milkchocolate and grapefruit, joined with some sea salt and baker’s spices. And yes, the peat is now unmistakable. Obviously not the medicinal type from Islay, but the type from the Highlands. And, boy, is this good!But the finish is the trump card: medium long, spicy and sweet, but soothing on hazelnuts and apricots with a pinch of salt.Surely this can be counted as liquid history by now, right?

All carry invitingly subtile soft Belgian chocolate and intriguing hints of rosy coffee.Palate:The exclusive mellow, yet full-bodied, character gives a rich, complex symphony of red fruit preserve, touches of treacle and the slightest mountain herb influence. Gentle clove oil, distant sour cherries and the softest peppery oak add a memorable sophistication to its rare vintage.Finish:The rarity of the vintage mirrors the rarity of the unique characteristics of the whisky.

2514,Glenglassaugh 1966  Rare Cask Series - Aged Over 40 Years Old,"Glenglassaugh 45 yo (49.2%, OB, decanter, refill sherry hogshead, +/-2011)  I loved the 40yo from two years ago (WF 92), let’s hope this baby will be in the same vein… Colour: amber. Nose: this is much punchier than the Dalmore, less delicately floral and fruity and rather more mineral and even a tad metallic (in a great way). Most interestingly, it smells a bit like some great whisky that would have spent many years in bottles. Develops on marzipan, a little leather, orange zests, old cognac, then whiffs of old wardrobe, unlit cigar, ham, maybe a little cardboard, old wine cellar, soot, aluminium (or mess tin…) I like this nose a lot but the palate might be trickier (with this kind of nose)… Mouth: no, this palate is lovely. Sure it’s not quite as complex as the nose – as almost always with these very old whiskies -  but the ‘feeling’ is excellent, rich yet very elegant, beautifully spicy, smoky and earthy, with also these metallic touches once again, mushrooms (morels, yeah, yeah) and then more tropical notes. Mango chutney, bananas flambéed (with rum, obviously), tinned pineapples… There’s also a little beeswax, then more black pepper and chilli… In fact, it’s quite complex on the palate as well! Finish: fairly long, a tad drier now, as always, a little leathery, grassy… And unexpectedly mustardy. Orange zests as well. Comments: great.

2524,Glenglassaugh 1967  The Massandra Connection,"Malt tip. Not the best Glenglassaugh I've ever had, but a really good malt!Intense fruity. There is certainly a lot of sweetness to be expected in the taste. If you take some time and just enjoy the flavors and individualized, raspberries and sugared plums are. Vanilla and the classic 'Old Bottle Flavor' are reminiscent of the good 4 decades that the whisky has been allowed to rest in ex-bourbon oak.As hoped, or rather as expected, velvety, fruity and sweet, without being over the top. A very elegant, multi-layered malt. Warming but by no means alcoholic hot. Pickled raspberries lead. In the background, oak spice, which, after more than four decades in the barrel of course, may be expected, and gives the Malt another dimension. I do not list any bitterness. Class! Cardamom, a bit spicy seasoning, but very discreet. Well-dosed green pepper works something like this.For a ungetorften Malt a long, well-balanced finish. Here too, the delicious, flawlessly integrated fruit notes are the primary source. Drying towards the end, as we know it in wines. One of my favorite effects is in the reverberation again this slightly mineral, that trail of lime that marks Malts in my eyes above average often. The Port Finish is the Glenglassaugh well anyway, no question."

Nose: once again, it's quite aromatic but probably less so than all the other old ones. I don't get much red Port (neither do I get any white Port ;-)), rather whiffs of old wood, old wine cellar, Spanish ham (bellota - indeed) and then a little game. Touches of date spirit, tobacco, brand new leather pouch, a little mud, very old pinot noir (gamy indeed)... Again a nice nose but... Mouth: but nothing, it's all fine this time and even if it's the oldest of them all, it's not the woodiest. It seems that the Port is more talkative now, with nice touches of raspberry jam, a little grenadine, maybe greengages... Having said that, there are quite some spices in the background again, cinnamon, pepper, cloves, cardamom (lots)... Before it gets sweeter again with, maybe, some blackcurrant jelly. Finish: medium long, with a pleasant balance between the green spices and the fruits. Comments: granted, when a skilled distiller 'patches' some very old whisky using wine casks it's never a very good sign but in this case - and as the price remains relatively moderate I think (doesn’t it?) it was most probably worth the hassle.  "
2526,Glenglassaugh 1967  The Massandra Connection,"A 1967 vintage whisky from Glenglassaugh. This has been finished in a Red Port Style wine barrel. The wine is made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, and is affectionately referred to as ""the Tsar`s port"".

2535,Glenglassaugh 1967 - The Manager's Legacy  Release No. 4 - Walter Grant,"This whisky has its own harmony. And in order to understand it, you need to approach the disclosure with slow short steps. You can't just come and start listening. Everything is important here: entourage, mood, freedom of thought, sensation ...  Here, hear, he has already started to play his melody. Let's silence and we will listen ...  The balance is wonderful, except that the taste was the start of the rocket aftertaste, letting a little sag in the overall outline. Just a few degrees, and this release would have reached the border of supermolts ...The aroma is enchanting, menthol, a lot of oak, but it is very delicate and not prevalent, the material for fillings, cherry tincture on cognac, Mikadamia nut, candied pears.  A few drops of water opened up exotic shades of fruit, overripe apricots, marshmallows, and orange confiture. Slightly brighter, but with water left velvet barrels and menthol, which is so mesmerizing in the age of youth. A step away from the ideal.  The second set. In statics - Lacquer, antique oak furniture, lacquered guitar deck, wood of a yacht with impregnation and varnish, musical instruments shop, leather, pinch of salt, red peony.  After rolling, walnuts, pitch, amber, mint, overripe dates, grandma's cherry jam or even cherry liqueur with leaf and spices, vanilla pie with zest, sprinkled with vanilla powder, garden lilies, juicy Greek apricots, plum jam. After an hour, a glass filled with the scent of tropical fruit and fruit tobacco.  The aroma is kaleidoscopic, it changes all the time, as if virtuoso’s fingers run around the fingerboard and all the time play a new improvisation, but within one stunning harmony.Light sour taste, very soft and enveloping, dense, plums, guava and oranges, sweet nuts, something like Brazilian. Inferior to the fragrance, but this is only against the background of the fantastic first phase.Monolithic finish, wood-nut, with smoky shades, menthol, a lot of dried fruits, blueberries, tobacco. Whisky lies in the sky with a velvet woody veil, it is surprisingly fresh for its age, but it is fantastically tailored and aristocratic, almost perfectly and delicately zadublen, no barrel domination."

Colour: amber. Nose: it's not whisky, it's some kind of old jam and it's truly wonderful. A maelstrom of figs, prunes, tamarind jam, blueberry pie, overripe plums, passion fruits, rich honey, beeswax, old sweet wine (Sauternes), sultanas… Really, it's beautiful. It could have been one of these very old Strathislas by G&M. Now, will the palate match the nose? It's not always the case with very old low-strength whiskies, let's see… Mouth: yeah well, the oak took over I'm afraid. It's still pleasant and even good, but you have to enjoy this drying tannicity. Plum pie topped with a lot of cinnamon and white pepper. Finish: medium long, all on old walnuts and bags of cinnamon. Strong black tea. Comments: maybe that was to be expected. The nose was absolutely magnificent but the palate had too much oak. Now, some tasters are less sensitive to oak than others and I know some fellow MMs scored this one very highly. As far as this 'Manager's Legacy' series is concerned, my fav was the 1974 'Jim Cryle', by far!  "

A whisky of two halves.I feel the fresh sherry cask, dates, raisins, new leather, rich malty character, red apples dipped in toffee, cocoa powder, and cologne.

For example, the General Post Office introduced the first postbus in Scotland. But also, Jim Clark was killed… (S., drop Wikipedia, now!) Colour: dark amber. Nose: it’s a ‘darker’, more chocolaty and more prune-y version of the 1972. A tad earthier as well, and a little more coffee-ish. Other than that, there’s almost as much honey, PX, and even sandalwood. Long story short, it’s just great again. Mouth: perhaps not. Some parts are very lovely, especially the honey sauce, the pipe tobacco, the dried figs and prunes and dates and even bananas… But the oak got a little loud this time, making it a little drying. Cinnamon cake plus ground coffee plus strong tea. All this is very very okay, don’t get me wrong, it’s just lost a part of the, say vibrancy that both the 30 and the 1972 had. A feeling of walnut stain – not that I drink walnut stain every day, of dried porcinis, and more coffee beans and bitter chocolate. Finish: medium, dry, and a little drying. More bitter chocolate and coffee. Comments: perhaps the death seat effect, since the 1972 was so great. So let’s remain fair and balanced… SGP:371 - 87 points."

It is also A bit salty (think brine).Palate: The palate delivers too, continuing on the old wood and mushroom combination, black tea and tobacco as well as a sweet note of old sherry.

2563,Glenglassaugh 1972  The Massandra Connection,"Another wonderful 70's Glassaugh bottling. The fat Bourbon barrel fruit with, among other things, light grapes and vanilla is supplemented with fine exotica (including mango, kiwi). The sherynots enrich the whole thing and give the extra kick. Above all, this malt takes time in the glass, let it breathe for at least one hour! Then it's going to be unearthly ...In the very first nose slightly ""herbaceous"", then intense ""winy"". Behind it are already the ""old barrels"". Ok, so an old boy must be able to breathe for an hour in peace! Then it really starts: The malt opens, the ripe white grapes come forward and also show something of the exoticism of the old Glassaugh barrels. The vanilla notes become stronger, supplemented by some kiwi. The sherry tones from the post-ripening can only be felt very tenderly in the background. Although from the Highlands, this is the finest 70s Speyside bright fruit and exotic fruit bouquet. In the background slightly wax and spice.But now! Much denser than in the nose, the sherry finish comes through nicely, but does not cover the bourbon barrel base in any way. The honey and wax notes enter into a dialogue with the fine-tender sherry notes and now the ""vinous"" notes (bitter rosé wine) appear again. Then grape fruit, wax and honey become stronger, the exotics increase (mango).The fruit bunch of the taste is also evident in the finish, in which, according to nature, some more wax and oak are added. Extremely fine."

You know, Caperdonich, Clynelish... A lot of fresh honey, pollen, ripe plums, quince jam, maybe mango chutney... All this is pretty brilliant, extremely fresh and not too powerful at almost 60% vol. I cannot not think of some old Sauternes, maybe even one that starts with a Y. With water: full on ripe mirabelles and quince jelly. Quince jelly is my Proust's madeleine. Mouth (neat): a total fruitbomb. Watch the kids. Passion fruits, mangos, tangerines, bananas, pineapples, kiwis... Right, I won't list them all. What's even more striking is the way it becomes even more citrusy after a few seconds, with more and more lemons and grapefruits. And once again, you don't feel the 60% vol. too much. With water: pure fruit syrup. Finish: quite long, very fruity, on the same tones and notes. Mirabelles! Fruity olive and almond oils in the aftertaste, always a great development. Even sugar cane.

2585,Glenglassaugh 1972  Rare Cask Release - Batch 1,"Drinker's Lounge    Rating: Great, delicious (★ ★ ★ ★ ☆)  CP: NR  Price: VE  Fragrance: rich and aggressive scent standing. The dense sweetness reminiscent of flesh and skin of red meat melon first comes first. After that it was very complicated, sweetness of grape juice with high sugar content, slightly oily nuance, sweetness of condensed grapes reminiscent of raisins, malt aroma with a sense of aging was felt from the back, fruit of heaping The ester incense which made it reminiscent of the assortment of assemblages as a whole. Melon sorbet and ice cream, slightly pasture grass. High-quality milk chocolate. The more you search for it, the more various flavors come out.  Taste: Also dense here. The sweetness and taste of malt having a sense of aging are felt, but the sweetness of the melon spreads further in the mouth beyond that. Impression that made scent elements powerful overall.  Reverberation: Aroma, take over the elements of flavor together. A condensed grape feeling from Sherry cask and a pleasant convergence reminiscent of bitter chocolate. The sweetness of the melon still continues, and with the slight spicyness it also has an impression like chilli chocolate. The reverberation is very long.  I think that it was recently talked about around 2014 that I enjoyed the taste of long-term aged sake of Glen Grassa relatively abundantly, but perhaps this taste is treated as a lost taste in the future I think that it is. To the extent that it seems so, Glen Grassa is a whisky with a wonderfully rich and complex flavor, which makes me feel reminiscent of melons that I can not see at all these days.  The historic Glen Grassa Distillery, founded in 1875, has been closed once in 1986. After a long closing period, on December 4, 2008, New Make Spirits flowed down again from the still, and sake brewed three years later was released as ""Glen Grassa Revival"" in 2012. My honest impression is that I do not know what kind of flavor the new sake after the resumption of distillation will acquire through aging in the coming years, to be honest. Regarding the sake after the resumption of distillation about the same long-term maturation as the bottle, perhaps it may be impossible to drink while she is alive.  That's why this whisky distilled in 1972 is a precious liquor distilled before closing the distillery. Here is the reason why the taste of long-term aged sake of Glen Grassa may be lost, but this bottle is used for aging due to the complex flavor acquired by sake by long aging This rich mellow sweetness obtained from Sherry Cask (Sherry Bat), I think that it is a rather rare bottle, which holds almost the balance close to miracles. I'm not drinking so much Glenter 1970 Distilling Glen Grassa, but this bottle is Glen Grassa feels that it has the perfection of its highest in my history.  Well, basically, when I taste the whisky, the glasses are unified in Glencairn, but with regard to this whisky, we can also taste the tasting together with a large glass of ""Burgundy · Grand Cru"" which is released from Riedel (The big glass on the left of the bottle in the picture shows that the tasting notes describe what was done at the bottle right Glencane.)  I think that Riedel's glass of Burgundy, Grand Cru was widely informed among whisky drinkers among the whisky drinkers thought that Mr. Katsuhiko Takemoto who is hosting whiskylink is the achievement, but just by changing the glass anyway, this whisky's A sweet flavor like a freshly ripe melon fruit having it is drawn out at once and it makes me feel really happy when I drink it. Using this glass makes you almost impossible to feel like oily and pasture grass and I think that the experience of thinking that the influence of the glass on the flavor of whisky is beyond imagination (Riedel's glass is quite satisfactory I seem to be selling rarely, I asked someone I got acquainted through whisky at that time.If it is a fixed price it is a very expensive glass, but I think that it was good to buy it. So we treat it quite carefully).  I think that pursuing how to taste your own drinks deliciously is one of the ways to enjoy a number of whiskys, but to enjoy changing the flavor of whisky while changing the glasses variously This is one way of pursuit. Alongside food mariage, I do not think that it is one of worth doing  https://drinkerslounge.wordpress.com/2017/03/26/glenglassaugh-1972-2014-41y-50-6-cask 2114-sherry-butt-582bottles-rare-cask-release/"

Thick, smooth mellow, oily, creamy sherry. Extremely well balanced notes of oak wood, vanilla, little toffee, dark chocolate, meaty and ham, even a bit salty.

Maybe not exceeded but met my very ..extremely high expectations!Typical 70ties Glenglassaugh but more complex, and fantastically balanced. Best cask from so called rare casks I tasted. After some time, even more spices, herbs, fruits, desserts, incredible!!!Everything here is somehow familiar with other rare casks but more accurate, more detailed, deeper, better balanced. Whole spectre of post sherry flavours with typical modern sourness and leathers,Very long, great wood, amazing complexity, great sweetness full of niuances, amazing whisky!!

Nose: Revealing depths of prunes and rum raisins over milk chocolate releases harmonious crisp oak spices and zest of lime.

Delicate woody notes, a slight orange bitter but it doesn't manage to take away from the fruitiness and manuka honey.Slightly drying, some dried prunes, gentle oak and a soft spice."

Soy sauce, sake yeast, pickled cabbage, meaty and salty.A little disappointment here, rather mellow, dusty and watery, sherry, soy sauce, metallic, beancurd, light body, some musk stick.

2599,Glenglassaugh 1972  The Master Distillers' Selection,"Glenglassaugh 1972 KWM Sherry Cask 39 Yr New Year Special! Bottled exclusively for KWM this single cask bottling of Glenglassaugh is a historical time piece. It is from a time where similar to today the whisky industry was booming. That boom ended in a bust that nearly was the end of this distillery. After closing in 1986 it did not reopen until 2007, and when it did there were just 400 casks of whisky remaining. This cask was selected by and bottled for Kensington WIne Market because it is an exceptional example of an older (nearly 40 year) whisky and a little piece of the heritage of its distillery. We went through more than a dozen samples of Glenglassaugh before settling on this cask. Andrew's Tasting Note: ""Nose: heavenly; molten brown sugar, candied fruits, toffee cake, Demerara rum and candied orange; hints of melons, coffee and chocolate too; Palate: sweet, sugary and spicy with more Demerara rum, molten brown sugar and an assortment of festive spices: ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamon and fennel; there are elements of chocolate covered coffee beans, candied orange and treacle sauce too; Finish: exceptionally smooth, rich, spicy and sweet with soft fading oak, lingering spices and more Demerara rum; melons and tropical fruits come out with a flourish of Dolce Leche at the end."""

2601,Glenglassaugh 1972  Rare Cask Release - Batch 2,"This is a good Glenglassaugh but far too expensive for what it is.Did Glenglassaugh finish it in a Massandra Madeira puncheon because they left it in the original cask too long and the tannins got to it, were they trying to cover this with the wine finish as they new it had been in the cask too long, we will never know?Does anyone actually know how long it was in the Madeira puncheon for, just curiosNot what I was expecting to be honest, I can  smell the wine from the finish, this is like a light sherried whisky in smell but much darker in colour.There is the usual dark fruit combo but also apple crumble mixed with biscuit, honey, there are also some nice toffee notes and hints of ginger and other spices.A nice nose but I am not one for wine finishes generally and wine notes detract in my view from the overall nosing experience but I am being a bit harsh because it is still a good nosing whisky.Good mouthfeel but like the nose the wine finish does not gel with everything else that is going on and there is some oak/tannins on show but at 42 years old that is hardly surprising?It seems to get lighter on the palate for a few seconds then there is a wave of spices which really liven things up in a good way.A little cream, honey, caramel, hints of apple, yellow plum and very faint hints of apricot.Finally the oak returns but it is manageable, luckily.Long, spicy and a little drying but it remains sweet.With Water:-On the nose there is a little more fruit and some wood varnish notes now, but the few drops of water have released much more fruit yet it has become a little unbalanced so only a few drops of water at most."

Shame I cannot justify buying a whole bottle. Of 6 glasses of 70s distilled whisky this had the longest maturation but caries away best of the night. I'm not saying Billy Walker walks into a warehouse of a distillery he part-bought and says 'rerack everything!' but if he was influential in the case of these old Glenglassaughs he could have only started this in 2013 so it is at most 2 years in this Madeira Puncheon, but that was probably enough.fruity and spicysweet, delicious with a touch of mintinessmedium; just a little dry"

As a particularly oily I would not describe him now. It runs down the glass wall relatively normally (so it does not take much time and does not really stick).  Aroma:  Even opening the sample brings a full force of aromas with it. With a hint of menthol, sweet and creamy notes such as vanilla, marzipan and grape juice concentrate spread through the Nosingglas.  The aroma reminds me of a freshly nibbled Belgian praline. I could smell it for hours. The overall impression is rounded off by some mild wood and malt.  Taste:  In the mouth you immediately taste the balance of scotch. Mild and sweet with slightly acidic notes, the spirits ran slightly oily down the throat. Very flattering but also a bit powerless, he seems to me. The oak tree surprisingly holds back and is not a soloist in this taste concert, although it is of course already recognized. The finish is nutty and a bit bitter.  finish:  The finish is medium to long and characterized by a pleasant sweetness. The Nachschmecken is a bit floral and slightly wooden.  Comment:  The aroma of this single malts is a pleasure. With enough self-discipline you could probably smell it for hours. The taste and the finish are fine for me. No revelation, but definitely a positive experience. For me personally, the taste is the sticking point and the stumbling block to the 90 points. Here I just miss something stronger flavors or ""whopping"".  Points:  89/100"

2613,Glenglassaugh 1972  Rare Cask Series - Aged Over 30 Years Old,A very old and limited Glenglassaugh - just 200 bottles of this famous 36-year-old sherried version from the 1972 vintage have been released. It was bottled in 2008 as part of the ongoing Aged Over 30 Years Old - Rare Cask Series. Each bottle is individually numbered and comes with its own certificate of authentication personally signed by Master Distiller Stuart Nickerson. 
2614,Glenglassaugh 1972  The Master Distillers' Selection,"Nose: Yeah, that's exactly what I love about the glass-eyes - tropical fruit salad with mango and papaya, a little spice from the refill Sherry Cask, cinnamon, nutshell, dried fruit, nougat, turkish honey, the fruits are getting more complex, ripe mandarin, some banana, sugared peach, fresh passion fruit, grapefruit, with almonds, a little oak, fresh vanilla pod, all melded into a very round, fat whisky that is hard to beat in terms of complexity  Taste: it starts incredibly sweet and fat, the alcohol is perfectly integrated, many fruits, banana comes to it, a lot of spices from the wood, especially cinnamon, oily, nutshell, you do not want to swallow it, but let it roll over your tongue for hours  Finish: forever, again this incredible range of tropical fruits, followed by a lovely fresh oak that will never be dry or intrusive. The malt stands a long time in the throat and then ends very slowly with fruits, marzipan, cherries, vanilla and a little coconut cream.  Water: No, just not, it does not need a single drop, it's so perfectly matched. Nevertheless, the attempt: Two drops make it even rounder, more fruity, even more complex.  Conclusion: It is on my eternal leaderboard in 2nd place, beaten so far only by an old Bowmore. For me, the best glass eye ever bottled. Many fans of Glenglassaugh prefer barrel # 2891, but personally I find this a little better. Even the kanpp 700 EUR, which are due today at auctions for here, he is loosely worth. The whisky itself convinces with a huge abundance of fruit flavors, supported by the excellent refill Sherry Cask, which adds many spices and subtle sherry flavors. The combination Glenglassaugh, 1972 and Refill Sherry fits just like ass on lid. You can just smell it for hours (it oxidizes very slowly in the glass, unlike other old sherry bombs), rolling in the mouth for several minutes and then just happy to enjoy the eternally long finish and at the same time makes anticipation for the next dram this excellent drop. At the latest the long finish ensures that you will not forget this whisky all its life. Simple: Potions - 96 points"
2615,Glenglassaugh 1972  The Master Distillers' Selection,"I have a hard time imagining an even better malt. Among those whom I know well, only calibers like the 1963 Bowmore ""30th Anniversary"", the Ardbeg 1974 ""Provenance"", the Macallan 1971 Fine & Rare and more recently maybe the 1970s Bruichladdich have released a similarly reverent enthusiasm with me.Intense purple full-ripe fruits. Here you do not have to think for long and brood for associations. The smell is about as intense as having the fruit under the nose. Pineapple and mandarin lead. In addition, the sweetness rising from a pan, when cinnamon sugar slowly melted. Unlike the 2014 Laphi Cairdeas not the idea of ​​cinnamon, but the barley brandy in my Nosingglas smells of cinnamon and vanilla in full splendor. Added to this are grapefruit, pickled plums and roasted almonds. The sugary sweetness turns after a few minutes of extensive taster to different honey notes. A touch of acetone, but rather contributes to the fact that the malt wins complexity, as to harm him. It's just terrific. Even the old Bowmores burned in the golden 1960s did not have more fruitiness than this 1972 Glenglassaugh. After a while rich vanilla notes, like from a freshly cooked, good vanilla pudding.The Fruchtpotpurri becomes a baked banana with acacia honey right at the beginning. Madness. This impression is reinforced by the velvety creaminess with which the malt spoils the mouth. The roasted almonds are still there. ""Amarettini"" it shoots through my head, basically just missing the crunch. A slightly peppery-spicy taste of fresh coconut milk is spreading. The hefty 57.5% are at best felt by the pleasant warmth that spreads the Malt in its unfolding in the mouth.For a long time the fruitiness of the banana, the honey sweetness and subliminally light vanilla notes remain."

This is obviously a pretty famous bottling for a reason.Clean, precise, doesn't veer off course from start to finish. Exemplary whisky. Oily, complex. Has a bit of a dry riesling feel to this. Sweet and slightly tart yellow fruits... starfruits, yellow grapes. A hint of peat and smoke? There is some rawness to this, despite its obvious maturity, that prevents this from being a total superstar.Lovely stuff. A class act from start to finish. Ends with a honey lemon tea note. 92-93 points."

2629,Glenglassaugh 1973  Black Ox,"Text from the SG Whisky Blog of Singapore:""The Black Ox, as the name suggests, is far more robust and imposing in colour, strength and character. Bottled at a far higher strength and exhibiting far more influence of wood in the flavour of the whisky and of course its colour, it is extremely aptly named after the Ox which typifies strength in the Chinese Zodiac.The colour and flavour suggests a far more active cask, and the whisky does reflect it with a myraid of flavours exhibiting both Sherry influences and the fruitiness of Glenglassaugh.Nosed neat, the whisky is an intoxicating mix of coffee, sweet chocolates, red apples, oranges, tangerines and orange juice. With water it reveals some dusted sugar and custardy and creamy notes. Fantastic!Neat: Sweet rich coffee notes dominate before some fresh fruits in the form of red apples and green pears. The tannins do dominate a bit.With Water: The bitter, aggressive and drying notes of the tannins and alcohol are all gone, revealing the fruit unhindered in all its beauty. Amazing stuff!Loads of red apples, sweetened coffee, but pear is the most prominent. A pleasant sweet finish that goes on and on. Water does not really influence the end, except with the removal of the drying tannins.This is overall a great whisky. Khoon said that of all the casks they sampled, this stood head and shoulder above all the rest, and with good reason. However, the overpowering tannins, which were overcome with water, affect the overall feel of this whisky just a bit. Nevertheless still fantastic!91/100""http://sgwhisky.com/blog/whisky-tastings/206-glenglassaughblackoxandwhiterabbit.html"
2630,Glenglassaugh 1973  Rare Cask Series - Aged Over 30 Years Old,"Nose: great complexity, beautifully integrated sherry with raisins and some chocolate and toffee and caramel, with a decent portion of cooked fruits (apples, pears, mango), dried dates, figs, a little clove, behind it even swings some smoke, but that is very subtle. In addition, there is always a little flower meadow with moist soil, the oak is very well integrated and balanced despite the age, it underlines the flavors with a light spicy and licorice notes. After a while cherry and almonds are added  Taste: round, harmonious, oily, fruity sweetness with sherry, dates, Ronisnen, cherry, subtle oak and floral notes, also the typical mango is stronger here than in the nose  Finish: medium to long, again the beautiful interplay of tropical fruit, sherry and flower meadow, with a slightly dry oak, which does not become bitter at all  Water: somehow I do not dare to give in water here .. Let's try it carefully with 2-3 drops: The Dram opens and is much sweeter with caramel and a little flower honey, it also looks significantly floral  Conclusion: What a grenade! He's one of the best I've ever had in my glass. Unbelievably complex, all flavors are interwoven and harmonious, nothing stands out, and yet you can get more out of the glass with every passing minute. In addition round, an oily mouth feeling and with a few drops of water one finds again another side. And a great example of using Refill Sherry Casks on longer maturing whisky. The sherry complements the malt, raises it to a higher level without affecting it too much. He leaves room for the ingenious distillery character of that long-ago time. No painting in between, for which one should take a long time, enjoy it and thank God for the fact that there are the Scots and their god's drink. The expectations were met - 94 points"

2638,Glenglassaugh 1973  The Massandra Connection,"SergeGlenglassaugh 39 yo 1973/2012 (50.7%, OB, The Massandra Connection, Aleatico Finish, 341 bottles) It’s funny because I had the opportunity to acquire a lot of old ‘Massandra Collection’ – not Connection - wines from Sotheby’s in the 1990s, you could get some pre-war Pinots or Muscats for less than £100 at the time. I’ve now tried dozens of vintages and most were quite brilliant – but I never came across any Aleatico from the old – or modern for that matter – Massandra estate in Crimea. In case you don’t know, Aleatico is a kind of red Muscat, so the name of a grape variety, not of a region. Colour: amber. Nose: with a good friend, we were making some quick ‘finishes’ using drops of PX the other day and believe me or not, this is the kind of result we achieved. Which may prove, once again, that most finishings are just legal ways of aromatising malt whisky with wine or other liquids. Having said that, this is quite a success, as the wine does not dominate the whisky and as we rather have a wide range of raisins (no I won’t list all the ones I know of) on top of some funny hints of Parmesan cheese or maybe even Comté. Anyway, those are very fruity and very elegant cheeses, it’s not ‘cheesy’ whisky ;-). With water: starts to smell like some classic old sweet sherried whisky. Dried figs, dates and mushrooms. Mouth (neat): yes, it works yet again. It’s not quite proper ‘old malt whisky’ because the wine imparted some much more youthful aromas (fresh raisins again, dried longans or litchis, figs, rum) but yeah, it works. Also nice notes of peppered dried beef and green peppercorn. With water: well, it doesn’t seem to swim extremely well, becomes a notch too grassy, almost ‘stalky’. Finish: medium long, with more jams and marmalades. Nice. Comments: I think the combo worked, even if we’re quite far from the wonderful very old Glenglassaughs we’ve been blessed with in recent times."
2639,Glenglassaugh 1973  The Massandra Connection,"With water: The alcohol actually works, but we try a few drops of water: wow, it becomes significantly fruity and looks incredibly fresh, noble sweet aromas replace the honey Conclusion: fantastic whisky, which takes a lot of time and a little water, the finish is great, but it shouldn't have been longer, but the combination of old malt with a ""red"" kick of freshness fits very wellred grapes, raisins, behind them mango with vanilla and cookie dough flavors, it needs air and time, then it becomes more and more sweet on the nose, dried figs, dates, beautiful notes of single wood, liquoricevelvety, sweet, red grapes, currant, raisins, vanilla, old woodMedium length, again red grapes, vanilla, a little mango and vanilla, forest honey and a pleasant wood shade on the back without bitterness"

2642,Glenglassaugh 1973  The Massandra Connection,"Colour: Amber-redNose: Vegetal, winey to very winey, with rather strong lychees flavours, some light honey and grassy notes. A rather unusual aromatic profile.Taste: Rich, spicy, very smooth, mellow, grassy, on honey, some pepper, lychees, some notes of red wine and berries, as well as some eucalyptus. The influence of the wine is less pronounced on the palate than on the nose. The finish is medium, grassy, spicy, very smooth, with some strawberries, lychees, tropical fruits, other berries, honey and some eucalyptus.Impression: Glenglassaugh tends to age very well and this one is no exception. At nosing, the winey notes are well present, but these flavours are fortunately less pronounced on the palate and work well with the spirit.

There is liquid gold in the glass, which conjures up sluggish tears with wide windows on the inside of the glass.  Nose:  The nose is magically seductive. Vanilla pod, curd cheese strudel with icing sugar on top, very dark honey. The alcohol is hardly noticeable. A pleasant scent of white chocolate rises and right next to it someone has baked apples with one or two cloves in the oven. Currants with whipped cream and caramelized nuts are complemented by moderately strong pepper. The scotch looks soft, creamy and sweet. At the same time, I have some cool peppermint in my nose. Grated coconut, walnuts and shells of peanuts are placed on a banana and pear mousse. A touch of fig, a little more apricot and delicious yeast pastries frolic in the nosing glass. This old, elegant malt is extremely pleasant to smell.  Taste:  The whisky is very sweet and fruity with a full body in the mouth. Clear vanilla, caramelized citrus and some bitterness from the grapefruit. Drinking cocoa, a hint of oak, a little liquorice and a hint of rosemary make the Glenglassaugh look nice and complex even in the taste. Overall, the taste is a fresh, fruity balance to the nose, which I feel is significantly sweeter than the taste. The malt offers no criticism. In the sense of ""whining at the highest level"" I could note that the taste is towards the finish. gets a little too watery.  finish:  I find the finish to be medium long. A little pepper, minimal bitterness as well as pepper and a hint of burnt breakfast toast comes to my mind. the finish is even more fruity than the taste. Here, too, very pleasant and a pleasure through and through.  Conclusion:  Yes, what can I say ... I got the sample from @StyrianSpirit. He is known as a pastry junkie across borders and that's probably why he likes this Glenglassaugh so much. In the glass it smells like in a confectioner's room.  You don't want to stop smelling and enjoying yourself. With a large bottle you will have a lot of fun for a long time!  92/100 (at least!)"

Conclusion: Absolutely no typical glass eye. The Muscat wine barrel does a great job here. The Distilleriecharakter is only hinted at. However, the sweet wine blends well with the typical Glassa fruit notes. Very round and complex, just the nose always releases new nuances - that makes the thing extremely versatile and exciting.

2670,Glenglassaugh 1973  The Family Silver,"[November, 2017]  I had this dram during a FoSM club tasting ""Through the decades - 1930's to 2000's"".  I bought this bottle with a black cap for 49 Euro in March, 2003.  To be honest, I really like this subtle and complex dram but I can fully understand that in the wrong setting (e.g., later in a line-up) this Glenglassaugh might taste rather dull and unimpressive.  So if you plan to try it - do it with a fresh nose and clean palate (...and you will be rewarded)!The colour is deep copper and the texture shows slow legs and fat sticky tears (a good oiliness!). The nose is very shy first and needs quite a while to open up - but even after that it is subtle and delicate (a dram that should be enjoyed pre-dinner only and placed at the beginning of any line-up). It offers fruits (apricots, yellow plums, cranberries), toffy drops, beeswax, vanilla, wooden and malty aromas in a fine balance.The taste is barley sugary sweet with fruity (yellow plums, quinces, apples), floral (like an alpine meadow), herbal and slightly sour (winey) flavours, really complex and enjoyable. Water releases more flavours on the palate but turns the mouthfeel somewhat numb and flattens the anyhow shy dram further. But it is worth a try to add some drops (if you have more than just a small sample at your hands).The initial mouthfeel is very nice: creamy and coating (just as the texture promised). The finish is short to medium on more herbal and floral notes (alpine meadow, again) without any major wood influence."

2680,Glenglassaugh 1973,"[August, 2019] A small sample of this old Glenglassaugh (remember: scores and notes based on small samples only are not as reliable because some drams demand a larger measure to enfold their full beauty, e.g. WB id 117033) - but this is perfect to get a first impression......and the question is: Why did they finish this methusalem dram? Usually this is done if a cask was rather inactive (leached) and did not contribute enough to the maturation process. And it seems this was exactly the case with this dram. It is completely dominated by the sherry flavours of the finish with very shy malt- and wood-driven aromas only. Very quaffable, no doubt - but in a blind setting I never ever would have guessed such an old dram (it tastes like a below 20-years old malt which by no mean is bad). It is very interesting to see such a finish working (much better than selling the dull stuff right out of the exhausted cask), but is this worth its extraordinary high price - I doubt...The colour is pale gold what is very pale for a 41-years old dram finished in a sherry cask. The nose offers a fresh profile that is mainly wine-driven with subtle aromas of the malt and woods only. This supports the thesis of an exhausted cask that had to be polished up by a fresh wine finish - and this worked pretty well. But to be honest, the complexity is rather limited given the 41-years of maturation...The taste is mainly wine-driven too without significant malt or wooden flavours. Do not get me wrong, this is a pretty fine taste but it tastes like a much younger whisky. This dram is greatly chewable and offers delicious chocolatey and toffee flavours this way. No flaw that I can find, but it owns a significant imbalance towards the winey flavours. Easy quaffable, for sure (if you do not have to pay attention to price tags).The dram arrives warming and coating on the palate without bitter or drying moments (after 41-years!) which again supports the inactive cask thesis. The finish is of medium length and adds some very shy spices, finally the wood shows up. No disctracting bitter or drying moments again, thanks to the leached cask. Water is not needed, it just flattens the dram."

2687,Glenglassaugh 1974  The Master Distillers' Selection,"[May, 2020] After finishing a myriad of private cask samples of (mostly) underaged single malts I look forward to do drink more adult malt during the weeks to come - and I start with this old and top-rated Glenglassaugh (thanks to VVP).......which is an excellent example of an old-style Highland malt with a complex, balanced and very interesting profile. It is both enjoyable to explore and dangerously to drink (both to the health of your body and pockets). I really like it!The colour is deep gold and the nose offers (out of a big spheric blender's glass) one of these adorable old-style Highland profiles with both fruits and waxes / oils in abundance. In addition there are different nuts (quite a lot), honeys, autumn floral impressions (hay stacks, fallen leafs), spices and much more. The wood is perfect in this setting, firm with a fine backing structure but never dominating (like the rhythm section in a rock band). All is pretty balanced and without any off-note. Stuff to sniff and explore for hours, no doubt. After significant breathing time the woods grow stronger as do the nuts, changing the profile significantly from the first impressions (but not in a bad way) - it stays complex and balanced.The taste is multi-layered on all the fine flavours of the nose with an interesting back-and-forth of sweet (fruits, molten sugars, honeys) and bitter-sour (waxes, spices, woods) flavours. In-between grassy, autumn floral and oily notes come and go and all stays in a good balance, again. No flaw on the palate either, this is very enjoyable stuff (if you do not remember the price tag while quaffing it).The initial mouthfeel (out of a standard Glencairn glass, never drink out of a blender's glass) is a little hot with peppery moments and coats all of the mouth instantly with a pleasurable creamy texture. The finish is long and adds more bitter impressions, now the wood takes control of the profile. It turns quite drying towards the end without getting too distracting. Water releases more old-style aromas (chalky-mineral, waxes) and smoothes the taste without flattening it - I like this dram both neat and reduced at different levels. Actually, it is great to play a little with water on this malt."
2688,Glenglassaugh 1974  The Master Distillers' Selection,"Upon first opening (about 6 months ago) I found it extremely hot on the palate. The nose was very good and no heat at all. I had 3 drams over a 6 week span and nothing changed; fantastic nose, palate way too hot, so hot that it buried the flavours. Adding water only killed the flavours even more and the heat was still way too prominent.Now 6 months later at half a bottle for oxidization to take hold, the heat on the palate has subsided quite a bit. Not total gone but it has dissipated enough to where the flavours are allowed to be enjoyed on the the palate, and the finish to a certain extent. The finish in medium (wish it was longer). Still a little heat on the backend.The heat on the palate is dissipating as I'm drinking this all the while the flavours are not, to the point on my last sip almost no heat. This is unlike 6 months ago with all 3 drams the heat would build to the point and being irritating. Not tonight. This puppy has really calmed down. All on its own. No water added tonight.I will seal this up and try it again in 6 months time. This is one of those bottles to take your time with and allow oxidation to develop little hidden treasures of sweet-flavours to come to the forefront on the palate. If all you want to do is nose it, have at her you will not be disappointed.Edit; Dropped my rating a couple of points due to the fact that (to me) this if just too hot and a little out of balance. Very fine flavour profile, but too sharp on the palate, all the while the nose is fine.Rich light-sweet sherry, light chocolate, malty-vanilla. You can smell this throughout the room. Incredibly rich and sweet to the nose without being overly sweet. And NO heat on the nose at all! One of the best noses ever.It enters with almost no heat but then it burns after a bit. Six months of oxidation later; chocolate liquor, sweet sherry with light maltyness with some brown sugar (It was probable there to begin with, but buried underneath all the heat). Not very complex but delicious! Mild heat after swallowing.Medium with a little heat. Not much added flavour wise in the finish."
2689,Glenglassaugh 1974  The Master Distillers' Selection,"Large sample from a friend. These 70’s Glenglassaugh’s have Brora level scores, which sets the expectations quite high; probably unfairly so. I must admit of the three I’ve had, I have never been blown away. Other than expectations and price, it’s still great whisky. PX sherry isn’t really my favourite maturation either, I find it can be a little syrupy sweet at times, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I find this the weakest of the three 70s Glenglassaugh I’ve had, which have all been very good, but imo, overrated. There are wonderful old notes to be had in here, but the alcohol is not in harmony with cask and thus becomes a little challenging to navigate. I feel it’s better with water, but too much and it becomes too sweet and simple. A couple drops for optimum performance.Starts on old coins, tart strawberry and rhubarb, I still find the alcohol here, but it’s less noticeable than the palate and finish. It’s rather sharp and direct without water. With water: creamier, buckwheat honey and soft waxes. Slightly leafy with old herbs, bigger lacquer note, putty and cold steel. I like it best with a little water.Hot and peppery. Chili oil (Thai chilies) over strawberries, Swedish berries, chocolate covered cherries, white pepper. With water: becomes jammy, syrupy sweetness, tomato vine umami note. The spice is knocked right down, but sweetness ramps up. Better with water, but finicky.Heat intensifies. First on white pepper and ginger, but then chili oil. Chocolate covered cherries, strawberry and chili infused jam? With water: syrupy sweetness again kicks the spice, but careful it becomes quite sweet. More accessible with water bringing the old herbs, lacquer, strawberry and rhubarb jam."

Sure there is some oak once again but it comes along these beautiful resinous and mentholated notes that are sometimes to be found in old casks (when it’s extreme it gets bad but it’s perfect here). Orange marmalade, passion fruit ice cream, mangos (very obvious here), tangerine liqueur, also a little chartreuse (these resinous notes again), verbena… Really excellent!

Red and green apples, pears, raspberries, Chinese fragrant pears, brandied raisins and lemon drops bring up a fresh fruity nose.Complemented with creamy custard and some raw nuts.Sweet, followed by pepper, clove and anise spice. The fruity notes then come to play with creamy banana, raspberries and fresh pears. Very pleasant.More pear, but this time more on pear peel, slight tartness with a lemon peel note.Simple and slightly underwhelmingA very delicate, fresh and easy drinking whisky, lacks the complexity but makes up for it in terms of drinkability. The lack of complexity and strength seems to affect the finish, which is rather simple.88/100Quaich Bar"""

Lots of tobacco leaves and humidors, as well as different nutty notes (walnut cake, cashew). Aniseed. Leather. Figs, melons and raisins with a bright, slightly acid top note (raspberry vinegar). Overall rather dry and a little shy maybe. Mouth: more fruity and sweet now. Red fruit jams, pomegranate, sweet rhubarb, baked apple with cinnamon and candied ginger. Faint notes of marzipan.

Colour: amber. Nose: we're not very far from the Manager's Legacy, except that this is milder and not any more vinous. Same touches of walnuts and cigars, maybe a little sweet mustard, then more raisins and figs, although it remains pretty dry. A little sawdust and coffee as well, then more and more high-end soy sauce.

Also a little leather and bitter almonds. Maybe a little rum as well, cough syrup... Finish: and another one that's long and spicy. Green peppercorns. Slightly tannic aftertaste. Ginger, cinchona.

2769,Glenglassaugh 1978  Rare Cask Release - Batch 3,"[April, 2021] A quick review of a small sample......which perfectly showcases what finishes are good for. I guess the original cask was a little inactive and did not add enough flavours to create a complex old malt's profile so they used a PX finish to compensate for that. And this worked brilliantly, it was just about the right time in the PX puncheon to extract enough sherry to enhance the profile without killing the malt completely. Well done at Glenglassaugh!The colour is mahogany and the nose offers an excellent old-style sherry profile without any flaw or off-note. The malt struggles hard to break through this massive wall of sherry aromas but with the help of some oxygen he succeeds, finally. The is a fine PX sherry finish with just the right amount of wooden notes (not too much, not too shy) which offers all the impressions one can look for in such a profile. A nose which is fun to explore in detail and very enjoyable to sniff.The taste is nicely layered on both winey and malty flavours with the woods staying politely in the background (I like that). The PX is strong but the malt manages to keep its head up high in this setting, but it requires some help (chew it). It releases barley sugars, honeys and waxes together with some shy floral impressions one after the other while the sherry is present all the time. The wood adds some spices but no bitter notes at all. Yes, this taste is not balanced but given the excellent sherry quality I do not miss the harmony as all flavours integrate perfectly without fighting each other. Great stuff to quaff, no doubt.The dram arrives warming on the palate and instantly coats all of my mouth with a creamy and nicely chewable texture. No distracting bitter or astringent moments here despite 38 years of maturation, wow! The finish is long and adds more impressions of (very) dark chocolate together with coffee beans and spices. Again there is not the slightest sign of over-aging. Water is not needed."

A beautiful finish, which is reflected in pleasant, sweet spices as well as honey, perfumed leather and cherry liqueur.

2776,Glenglassaugh 1978,"[July, 2018]  Finally I do a full review of this special release tonight after wa.com provided me with a full sample at Limburg Whisky Fair.  whiskyauction.com is probably the oldest internet auction platform for fine whiskies and they do check if a bottle is a fake or not (most auction houses simply do not care).  Over the long time they are active now they gathered a lot of know-how in identifying a potential fake.  In such a case they do not accept the bottle and return it to the seller - so a buyer can be pretty sure he will get genuine whisky when the hammer falls.  By the way, contrary to most other auction houses the auction fee is paid by the seller and not by the buyer - so the buyer has to pay the hammer price only (plus p&p).  The colour is russetmuscat and the texture shows a fat sticky ring that builds fat sticky with very slow legs (a fine oiliness, for sure).  The nose offers a subtle and delicate autumn floral sherry profile with lots of herbal, fruity and sugary aromas in a fine balance.  It needs some time to fully open up so take your time when nosing this dram.  Surprisingly there are no significant wooden notes in the nose despite 36 years in the cask.  The whisky arrives warming and instantly coating in the mouth with just a slight bitter-astringent feeling from the tannins (there is the wood!).  The taste is complex and layered on a rather modern sherry profile (did they re-cask this whisky after 1989 because of an inactive first cask - at least the profile directs somewhat in this direction and you know, a bottler does not have to state any re-casking as long as it stayed longer than three years in the new cask.  A shorter period is called a finish.)  Very interesting, and if so they selected a completely sulphur-free cask luckily…  Actually I like this profile very much as it combines both old-school and modern-style maturation elements and it is greatly chewable.  Dozens of different flavours pop up over time without any off-note and all in a perfect balance.  The finish is long and adds more spicy wooden flavours that work very well in this setting.  No distracting moments here either, just a minor drying-astringent feeling at the very end (that does not hurt).  Water turns the taste sweeter without increasing any bitter notes but it is not needed, actually.  This dram is perfect as it is.An excellent selection by Thomas and the team of whiskyauction.com that is worth the 20th anniversary of this professional auction platform.  This bottle is not cheap but I think it is worth the bucks - but remember, take your time with this dram.  It needs about 20 minutes (or more) to fully enfold its beautiful profile both in the nose and on the palate. "
2777,Glenglassaugh 1978,"The nose was the highlight, otherwise also a round, good malt, but the low% and a touch of modernity of the oak are not so perfect due to the late 70s.Wowww, super positive weird, would blindly guess 100% on Mizunara barrel Japanese with 20+ years, somewhere between ancient Hanyu and Yamazaki, those raisin-yellow gummy bear notes from Mizunara, then again after 15 minutes it drifts off towards antique Bourbon with 20 + yo , get the coniferous forest and subtle cedar wood with maple syrup and white oak from Pappy 20+ soaked in honey, almond tartlets, candied walnut, as intense for the%, more like 50-52% ...

2783,Glenglassaugh 1978,"Whiskydream.de has rated:  Glenglassaugh 36 years (1978-2015) Cask R2053 / 2344  (Region: Highlands / OA bottled for WhiskyAuction.Com / 41.2 Vol /%)  We rarely have such an old whisky in our glass. With more anticipation, we turn to the tasting. The 36-year-old Glenglassaugh was allowed to spend his time in ex-PX sherry barrels breathing the air of the Highlands and was bottled by WhiskyAuction.Com at the age of 20. It appears in very dark amber with some copper and is naturally unfiltered. He smells sweet, chocolate-creamy with distinct sherry notes. Dark, dried fruits (especially raisins), but also banana and a hint of cinnamon combine with the sherry-chocolate aromas or better: an interplay of (predominantly dark) fruits and dark chocolate with a dash of sherry is created. The age is clearly noticeable. (90)  The sherry is clearly present in the mouth, with dry, woody aromas. In addition, a light liveliness and always present the dark, creamy dark chocolate! Some coffee beans, raisins and some herbs in the background. Very concentrated overall, an almost syrupy sensation spreads in the mouth. Wonderfully balanced and round! (90)  The medium-long to long finish is slightly bitter, characterized by sherry barrel. Again, a creamy sweetness comes to the fore. Very full-bodied until the end. (90)  Overall rating: 90 points  Conclusion: Glenglassaugh, a round, well-balanced and dignified aged from start to finish, who, at the end of the day, accompanies the gourmet into the realm of sweet dreams.

A great whisky, no question! Very delicious!first grapefruit, blood oranges, dark chocolate, furniture polish, wonderfully clear nose; after 20 minutes, the nose changes completely, now someone is brushing strawberries next to me, shortly thereafter stands next to me a giant bowl of chopped fresh strawberries. Now the dark chocolate changes to milk chocolate. This is joined by other dark berries, raspberries, black currants. Later floral notes in crystal clear forest air, peppermint tea, on the edge almonds and sugar necklace from the faircrystal clear and downright brilliant, the malt comes into the mouth - superfruit - oranges, grapefruit, dark chocolate, fine sweet, but dry, the first sip is like a dip in the sea in the early morning. Great! Then come the strawberries again, followed by raspberries, black currants, green tea, black tea, mint tea, all incredibly fresh. Now marzipan, slightly burnt dark caramel, candied apples, star fruit with chocolate coating and ginger. The ginger builds up slowly and steadily. The barrel notes are present, but never superficial, the first violin playing the clear intense fruit notes.fruity without end with a touch of milk chocolate and mint. The ginger also remains long. Fine sweet-bitter, simply very noble."
2794,Glenglassaugh 1978  Rare Cask Release,"More on: https://tomtrinkt.deA fresh strawberry field just before the harvest comes straight to my mind. Wonderfully fruity, with many more red fruits. Raspberries, redcurrants and cherries join. In the background, a pleasant oak woodland lingers without being too dominant. After a good 20-25 minutes, I perceive a handful of almonds, a touch of juicy oranges, dark chocolate and still float this (surprisingly) fresh, subtle aroma in the glass, which I would almost classify as mint / eucalyptus. Very amazing, since the whisky was allowed to mature for over 36 years.At the beginning a relatively strong onset (only 41.9% alcohol) with an incredibly oily, even creamy, mouthfeel. In addition, very saliva-stimulating with a minimal tingling on the tongue. The typical Portweinnoten make themselves immediately noticeable. Again, I find the fresh, red fruits, especially sweet strawberries and raspberries take over quickly the upper hand. Juicy oranges, roasted aromas, nuts, almonds and spicy oak notes, with a slight dryness, follow. Very harmonious, round and multi-layered, almost dangerously tasty.Medium to long, here the spicy oak notes quickly pick up speed. The sweet strawberries fade gradually. A slight dryness and bitterness complete the finish."
2795,Glenglassaugh 1978  Rare Cask Release,"Wow. 91 points.Sweet fruits are right in the nose. Peach apricots, cherries and apple rings from Haribo. Oak is on board and gets stronger every second. Herbs. Chocolate with orange. Will then become more supple and the sweetness increases. Baked apple with cinnamon and sugar ..... Simply pure enjoyment. Wood becomes clearer again - back and forth.Whisky? What about the alcohol? Such a soft yet intense mouthfeel is rare. Fruit mix neatly sweetened. The fruits are all there, none dominated, everything is there at once. And sweet, infinitely tasty! Then oak comes to it and gives the bitter counterpoint.Medium to long, fruity and spicy, a hint of pipe tobacco."
2796,Glenglassaugh 1978  Rare Cask Release,"Nose: overripe oranges, sour cherries, orange peel, jasmine tea, a vinous fruit acid, which I would associate with the port. A very elegant vanilla and spicy bitter oak flavors are also to be found. The oak aromas remind me of sawdust of freshly cut wood, mixed with port wine with a good dose of mint. Furthermore, I associate chocolate and lots of nut flavors - walnut, nutmeg and roasted hazelnuts are the most likely to hit it. In short: very complex, elegant and old. The old port wine barrel is definitely felt and also flavors like tobacco, old leather couch and old bookshelves not missing.  Taste: At the beginning very soft and very spicy. Toasted aromas, old leather couch, unburned cigar tobacco and nutmeg associations. After a few seconds comes a fairly dominant vinous tingling fruit acid of the port accompanied by vanilla. The fruit acid is reminiscent of plums, cherries and dark berries and remains present for a long time on the front tongue center.  The finish is characterized by a combination of peppermint tea, about 60% chocolate and a Port-Remaining fruit, which remains really long presence. The finish is hardly really tart, I would have liked a little more oak bitter substances in the form of coffee, this one is more herbal tart. Overall but very soft, elegant and feels cool for a long time in the mouth. However, in my opinion, the drop could have a bit more alcohol content. But  Conclusion: a really successful Glenglassaugh. Old, elegant with a very pleasant fruit acidity, which blends perfectly with the spicy flavors so sympathetic to me. The nose, and the taste are great cinema. Only the finish for me could have a bit more tart oak flavors. Otherwise very interesting and delicious!"
2797,Glenglassaugh 1978  Rare Cask Release,"Complex, rewarding, and absolutely tasty. A true connoisseurs’s dram; exclusive, but way to good to just let it collect dust on a shelve. Glenglassaugh is owned by the same South African folks who are at the helm of Benriach and Glendronach. At the end of last year, they started issueing their rare cask releases akin to the Glendronach or Benriach single casks, but a little more premiumized. Glenglassaugh was closed for almost two decades between 1986 (Thanks Mrs. Thatcher!) and 2008, so you either get very old ones (30+) or very young. These are all highly sought after and have a cult following among many malt anoraks, especially in Germany, where Andrea Caminneci was (and still is afaik) the sole distributer for Glenglassaugh. He also has, reportedly, one of THE tastiest Glenglassaughs bottled specifically for him. A 1972, what else…Dense. Citrus fruit with a thick layer of brown sugar. Pink Grapefruit, many many oranges, and Pomelo. This needs air. Lots of it! After a few minutes new layers are emerging. Mild oak spice, and … wine gums? The fruit notes are converging and become more intense with some air. Then, a cooling sensation followed by bees wax and hints of shoe polish.More sugared grapefruits at first. Drying quickly. Mentholated honey, a dive into a meadow full of mountain flowers. In other words; herbal. It is back and forth between dust and juice. What a chameleon.Medium-long. A very pleasant bitter-sweet departure (and not only because my sample is so small!). Milk chocolate and orange caramel."
2798,Glenglassaugh 1978  Rare Cask Release,Producer ́s Tasting Notes Colour: Hints of Rose in a rich golden body. Nose: Strawberry jam with a pepper spice fill an intriguing delicate coastal nose. Palate: red fruit compote spiced with peppercorns and clove mellows to sour cherries.

For one thing, it is just a bit too weak and less complacent in the taste for the very strong nose than the nose promises. In addition, the oak and the sherry are too dominant for me to achieve a top rating - 88 points"
2804,Glenglassaugh 1978  The Master Distillers' Selection,"What a dream drop! Incredibly intense and complex, the old Glenglassaugh shows me what a dream fabric was made in the past. So far I only had 2 young ""glass eyes"" in the glass and was not very enthusiastic ... This 1978 Glenglassaugh shows impressively why the old bottlings from Glenglassaugh are so popular with many Maltheads, dream material just to melt away and enjoy!  23/24/23/23 (93P)The Glenglassaugh shimmers slightly cloudy amber in the Premium Snifter. Fermented fruits rise majestically with roasted hazelnuts, sweet raisins compete with chewed peanuts and hazelnuts, whole milk chocolate and caramelized sugar stimulate the flow of saliva. The wonderfully voluminous fruit notes become more intense, a tropical fruit mix mixes with apricots and pears, roasted aromas are released from nut chocolate, the nose is just incredibly complex and voluminous! Wet cereal grains appear minimal, raisins in rum end in pineapple and mango. I could smell that giant nose for hours!Incredibly substantial, almost chewable, the first sip is poured over the tongue. Dark and dried dates mix with apricots and other dried fruits while intense hazelnut and whole milk aromas envelop the tongue. Gradually there is a subtle sharpness, minimal spicy wood and creamy roasted aromas appear, a pinch of colored pepper gently massages the lips before dark wood tones gradually move smoothly into the foreground. Chubby warmth rests on the palate, creamy toffee and caramel play with spicy oak, roasted hazelnuts fall in milk chocolate. In terms of taste, the Glenglassaugh is burning an incredible taste fireworks, rarely have I had such a moment of pleasure!Hazelnuts and chocolate stick gently on the palate, minimally sulphurized raisins and dates mix one last time with tropical fruits and old, intense apricots and pears. Tart and spicy wood tones appear minimally on the palate, subtle wooden sharpness returns, hazelnuts and remnants of milk chocolate stick to the inside of the cheek, minimally tobacco and leather appear surprisingly in the aftertaste. Wonderful!"

2806,Glenglassaugh 1978  The Master Distillers' Selection,"Water: No, he does not need it - but we still try it with a few drops: as so often, if you think he needs no water, you will be surprised when trying. That's the way it is here, the malt explodes in the nose. Significantly sweeter, many of the fruit notes described are now only definable, in addition to a few citrus fruits, especially orange peel I mean to identify.  Conclusion: Again, an example of the simply successful malts of the 70s from this great distillery. He needs some time and especially some water to develop properly, but he rewards with a sherry-based fruit basket. Even if he can not beat the distillates from the years 72/73, it is still a great whiskyIt starts with a sweet hazelnut note, in addition to other sherry flavors such as figs, dates and a bit of plum compote and chocolate, also a few rum raisins can be found. In the background, the typical tropical fruit mix seems to have dominated the Distillerie character of the 70s: mango, lychee, papaya I can cry out, but also dried apricots and fresh peaches. Add a touch of pepper and some ginger, which provide a slight sharpness. Finally, some oak flavor, which I would best describe here as a pencil abrasion. All flavors are very well interwoven and self-contained, harmonious and complete the very complex nosesoft, velvety onset, in the mouth the malt has a nice, slightly oily texture. First, you notice the sherry finish, especially dry fruits, nuts and some chocolate are noticeable. But also the lighter fruits come through, in addition to a nice toffee sweetness, as well as some oak tanninsThis is medium long, characterized by sherry (again hazelnut and cocoa) and tropical fruits, but this less clear than in the nose Hintenraus then packs the oak more clearly, it will add some spices such as cinnamon, clove, leather and tobacco flavors, even a light but not disturbing bitterness makes itself felt"
2807,Glenglassaugh 1978  The Master Distillers' Selection,"So for me - and also for a middleman and in direct comparison to two other Glenglassaughs - the nose of this sample is simply overlaid with sulfur. The sulfur can also be felt on the palate and weaker in the finish, which nevertheless leads to decent pleasure for those who do not consider sulfur to be an absolute exclusion criterion. The sherry substance with plum fruit sweetness is very pleasant. Nowhere in this rehearsal can I discover the ""Glenglassaugh character"".Oh, unfortunately, there is egg sulfur. And a lot of oak. Even after half an hour of ventilation and at the end of the tasting after about an hour and a half. Behind it, of course, sherry and some plum fruit can be sensed. Unfortunately not a pleasant aroma.The sulfur takes a back seat; Sherry answers, as does plum. And then the sulfur comes through easily and delivers a match with the strong oak. In addition, the malt is very sweet again with cinnamon and plum roaster, now also a little apricot. A strange mix. In the mouth, the sulfur note only slightly covers the other formidable aromas, so that's a 91-point pleasure. But really only for those who tolerate some sulfur and do not define it as an absolute exclusion criterion.Even in the rather medium-long finish, the sherry and fruit notes, paired with intense oak, are even stronger than the sulfur. Which gives me 89 points with the above-mentioned limitation."

2826,Glenglassaugh 1978 Mhairi McDonald  The Chosen Few,"[January, 2021] Finally, after tasting a lot of new bottlings released just before Christmas I find the time to go for the samples provided by a good friend some time ago......and this is an excellent start, as expected. These old Glenglassaugh offer complex and very tasty profiles, mostly and this is a trademark example of such a fine old-style malt. Unfortunately this is way too expensive these days, but if you come across a sample go for it.The colour is deep gold and the nose offers a complex and delicate old spirit-driven profile with lots of different fruits (both home-grown and exotic) in a firm spicy-waxy setting. This is exactly what I like about the traditional (old) style of malt whisky: Many different tasty aromas combine to a complex and balanced mixture without entering a fierce bottle over dominance (as with so many modern drams). A nose to sniff for hours.The taste is nicely layered starting with all the fruits before the spices jump in. The waxes and florals take their time to show up but after they did the profile gets even more powerful. This is an interesting back-and-forth of sweet and bitter flavours which is a lot of fun to explore. The sherry is rather shy (the cask was quite exhausted but this is good for long-time maturations like this) which fits perfectly to the subtle malt aromas. And the short finish was perfect to not overpower these delicate flavours with wooden notes - I wish today's master blenders would act as careful but the modern ""whisky zeitgeist"" is different, unfortunately.The initial mouthfeel is warming and instantly coating with some peppery moments which are not distracting at all. The finish is long and adds more waxes and spices that turn the profile even more old-stylish. There is no bitter or astringent impression until the very end, this dram was bottled at the right time. Water releases tasty honey aromas in the nose and turns the taste smoother but the layers are gone now (like so often). I like to nose this dram somewhat reduce but prefer to drink it neat (using two glasses)."
2827,Glenglassaugh 1978 Mhairi McDonald  The Chosen Few,"I was wondering why a bourbon barrel with an approx capacity of 190 - 200 litres was able to yield 275 bottles of 0,7l (= 192,5litres!) after 33 years maturation time.This would have meant that the angels only lowered the alcohol.What is the miracle behind?It was for 32 years a refill Sherry butt, and for the last 12 months, the whisky was finished in a fresh bourbon barrel.See also the info I have found on the Glenglassaugh webside (published June8th 2012)Chosen FewAfter the success of the last Chosen Few, we are just about to release the next one. This time it is a 1978 refill sherry cask which has spent the last 12 months of its life in a first fill bourbon. It is another complex whisky which is well balanced with the classic Glenglassaugh fruit flavours and the spices and drying that come from the wood. It will again be bottled at cask strength and without the use of colouring and with no use of chill filtration.The whisky has been chosen by Mhairi McDonald who is the production manager at the distillery and who many of you will have met if you have visited here, as she often takes people round the distillery."

A bit too long in the barrel? Oily texture but not warm and thick (perhaps because we were drinking this out in the cold?).A bit oaky, tart, continued sweetness. A good, aged bourbon cask. I just looked at the cask info: it's mostly matured in refill sherry... not much sherry detected, FWIW."
2829,Glenglassaugh 1978 Mhairi McDonald  The Chosen Few,"SergeGlenglassaugh 33 yo 1978/2012 ‘The Chosen Few’ (46.3%, OB, Mhairi McDonald, bourbon, 275 bottles) Just like the ‘Manager’s Legacy’, this series never disappoints. Well, I’ve only tried one so far ;-). Colour: gold. Nose: it seems that it’s one of these ‘old’ noses that start to display some wee notes of camphor and mint above a bed of roasted nuts, wood smoke (even charcoal) and walnuts. So we’re going toward vin jaune, fino or manzanilla, with even faint touches of mustard. It’s absolutely not ‘boubonny’. Mouth: excellent! Some complex notes of old polished wood, nuts, toasted brioche, mead and cinnamon. Perfect spiciness (ginger again and again, cloves, cardamom) and then more bitter oranges. It’s one of these bourbon casks that do hint at sherry wood, which is quite tricky if you taste whisky 100% blind. Finish: medium long, a notch rounder (vanilla) and spicier at the same time. Quite some spiced honey in the aftertaste as well as a little mango. Chutney? Comments: simply extremely good, with a lovable complexity."

2832,Glenglassaugh 1978 Mhairi McDonald  The Chosen Few,"This 33 year old Glassaugh is a mystery. Matured according to the description on the bottle in bourbon barrels, according to the information at this point before 32 years in refine sherry casks, it shows very clear sherry tones and plays in the aftermath with the notes of light grapes, ripe cherries, vanilla and cinnamon. The longer you look at this malt, the more exciting the story, because now also pulls out of the Nosingglas the fruit and from the Bordeaux red wine glass signify very definitely mint, oak and leather. This is a malt that should give you time - he thanks it with a long, intense pleasure ...The first impression is surprisingly strong, sherrytönig and the baked apple notes are not missing. Only then come, almost shy, the usual from the Bourbonfassreifung vanilla and grape notes. This wild mixture is spread on a very fragrant mint bed sprinkled with cinnamon. The more often and longer you smell, the more fruity and intense this arrangement of the fragrances becomes.If the Glassaugh with its 46% in Nosingglas pulls wonderful streaks, it comes accordingly wonderfully oily in the mouth and reveals here also the sherry and dark fruit tones, followed by extremely pleasant mint tingling. Later, the oak will come in as well. The bright fruits I have not in the first button, the second, they rise quite shy from the sprinkled with cinnamon mint.The finish from the Nosingglas is long, again dominate sherry, ripe cherries, oak and for the first time also some leather appears."

Dates, forest honey and typical sherry flavors such as cane sugar and raisins, but in a subtle way not as strong as modern sherry soups. Something fresh, the alcohol is a bit cooling and smells a bit like menthol. Dark chocolate mixes with it and then it's back to the fruits - apples, apricots. I also find light leather. Very complex and with extremely well integrated alcohol. You can smell it for hours. after a long time in the glass, ripe tropical fruits and some honey and candle wax are added. taste Soft, very soft and round. Also great integrated alcohol. But then he could have a little more strength and taste for me, somehow he has a short hangover for me right after he comes into my mouth. Significantly less sweet, more oak and a slight bitterness. The apricots are gone, even if the rather spicy honey is still there. Very strong herbal tea aromas, plus a little menthol - together that makes a nice cough drop like Ricola? Over time, the spicy forest honey comes out again. Towards the finish, light white pepper that mixes with it. Exit Here stronger again, but still with at most minimal alcohol. Also very spicy and tart, lightly bitter with lots of oak and herbal tea. NUn light pepper on the edge of the tongue. Afterwards, the herbal note sticks in the mouth for a long time, with a bit of forest honey and light liquorice. Some espresso and slightly nutty.

2869,Glenglassaugh 1986  Rare Cask Release - Batch 1,"This malt is undoubtedly something for the friends of PX and ""sweet"" Oloroso barrels, prunes, vanilla and elegant oak, which are served in liqueur consistency. A total seducer. You have to give the single malt time, so that behind his (finished) sweetness he also reveals his profound flavors (pear, vanilla).The scent of cherries and sweet sherry rises immediately and immediately after pouring out of the glass. This remains the first impression after the malt could breathe for about half an hour in Nosingglas. Now prunes join in addition, a pleasantly light menthol note underlays the oak; From a distance, delicate vanilla fragrance appears. Vanillekipferl meets cherry pralines.Comes extremely oily, almost liqueur in the mouth. There, the sherry is a bit drier, the cherry is less sweet and is complemented by ripe Hauszwetschken. Over time, the oak comes in as a spice, vanilla remains in the background.The finish also emphasizes the sherry dark fruit character. Finest oak and a pleasant, spicy warmth dress the mouth and warm the throat. This is also the age recognize."

Menthol, aniseed and even a tad salty.Wonderfully velvety and soft, on dried fruits as mentioned previously. There is also mandarin liqueur, soft spices, almonds, vanilla and some salt.Soft, with mild spices, dried fruits (sultanas, dates), marzipan, vanilla, mandarin liqueur."
2871,Glenglassaugh 1986  Rare Cask Release - Batch 1,"[February, 2021] There is excellent stuff of the Glenglassaugh distillery from the seventies of last century, no doubt. But the eighties were rather shaky throughout the whole Scottish whisky industry because a serious sales crisis started in 1983 (ignited by a new health trend in the US which almost halved whisky sales in this most important market over night). So many distilleries were taken over by controllers who cut the budgets on almost everything (ingredients, casks, maintenance)......but this did not seriously harm the Glenglassaugh spirit in 1986, but the cask maturation obviously. This is one of the earliest modern sherry vintages I came across so far with the typical sour winey notes which come from the young wine used to season the sherry cask (which was used to finish this obviously bourbon-hogshead matured malt up to then). By the way, it makes no sense to call this Oloroso or Fino or PX etc. because these different sherry styles develop in the solera system over many years only and they do not own any sour-winey impressions anymore (after that). Only very few casks are seasoned with such (much more expensive) old sherry since decades, sadly. Nonetheless, even modern sherry casks can create delicious stuff and this release is a good example on that, no doubt. But to be honest, given the wide variety of other fine sherry-matured drams out there I would not pay more than 100 Euro for such a drinking pleasure (as there is nothing special about it because of the limited maturation effects in the leached bourbon cask and a rather standard modern young-sherry finish after that). A dram for collectors...The colour is deep copper and the nose offers a nice modern sherry profile with its trademark sour-winey aromas. Luckily, the finish was not that long to bury all the malt but nevertheless the malt flavours are rather shy, obviously the cask was quite exhausted when they filled the spirit in 1986 (remember the budget cuts on cask purchases during the whisky crisis?). But that is why finishing was invented in the first place and it works pretty well with this nose.The taste is sherry-fruity sweet with barley sugars, bitter herbs and tannins as well as spices. A very tasty combo, indeed. The wood is strong but still okay, wood-heads might even find this excellent. Water releases more aromas both in the nose and taste, adding tasty chocolatey and toffee impressions. Actually, I like this dram best when a little reduced.The initial mouthfeel is warming and slightly drying-astringent from tannins which is not a great deal because the sweet sherry flavours sooth this immediately. The finish is of medium length and adds more barley sugars and spices which are tasty. The end dries out a little but again this is no major deal."
2872,Glenglassaugh 1986  Rare Cask Release - Batch 1,"Jelly BeansUntil recently, Glenglassaugh released some single casks in their highly acclaimed Rare Cask Series. But with the sale by Billy Walker (who then went on to purchase Glenallachie), I am not sure if we’ll see many more of these rare casks. This is one from the very first batch: a 28 Year Old from 1986 that was released in 2014 and by now has become all but unaffordable. Oh, that color…Those is rather austere at first and only mildly fruity. But if you leave it to breathe for a while, the reward is massive. Apples, pears, peach and cherries, but also something candy-like that reminds me of Jelly Beans. Loads of earthy notes. A leaf of mint. Marzipan? Lovely hints of oloroso sherry, by the way. In the background you’ll notice a slight whiff of sulpher, but it is so light, that it actually contributes to the experience. That’s a first. Delicious nose.The body could have been a bit more creamy in my opinion, but the taste is spot on. Wonderfully fruity on baked apples, pears and cherries, upholstered with dried fruits like dades and (to a lesser degree) raisins. Clear notes of Sevilla oranges, almonds and vanilla. Marzipan – which was a bit doubtful on the nose – comes to the fore. Gently spiced on cinnamon and nutmeg. More hints of vanilla and even a little salty edge. Complexity, anyone? In the medium long finish, a mildly bitter touch from the oak kicks in, but it does not detract from the fun. The dark, dried fruits linger in a screen of woodsmoke.Absolutely grand Glenglassaugh. Thanks a million, Timon!"
2873,Glenglassaugh 1986  Rare Cask Release - Batch 1,"@ Snaunja and Whiskyhamster: on the label it is stated that it was finished in the hogshead, so that clarifies the angels' share question.

After adding water: watermelon, wet plaster and light licorice.Sweet and sour with a strong salty trace. Thick to creamy. Walnut, orange peel, sapiness, green olive, salted pumpkin seed, green apple, milk caramel and light pepper.

2895,Glenglassaugh 2008  The First Cask,"Glenglassaugh First Cask, 3 yo, 2008-2011Initial nose: hints of new make, sherry notes, salty, white pepper, stewed fruit (pear, apple)After aeration: the new make is gone and made place for some sophisticated sherry (Palo Cortado kicking in) and warming vanilla.Taste: sweet sherry notes – especially the PX- dominate the palate (sweet raisins), gingerbread, light spices, not too alcoholic despite the high abv, fruity again. No new make in the taste.Finish is medium to long, with the sweet sherry notes lingering on. More Palo Cortado on the nose ( a bit more refined than the PX)In short: for a 3 yo, this is one fantastic dram. It also shows what good wood policy can do. The fact that this dram is already so refined at 3 years of age, shows the influence of some excellent sherry casks (PX and PC). If this is the road that Glenglassaugh will keep walking on, success is guaranteed."
2896,Glenglassaugh 2008  The First Cask,"The very first cask, a refill butt, that was filled on that ""first cask filling day in 2008"" was emptied and refilled into 2 smaller casks on the 16th December 2010. These smaller casks were a first fill ex-Pedro Ximenez (PX) sherry hogshead and a first-fill ex-Palo Cortado sherry hogshead. On the 16th September 2011 the whiskies were returned from these two casks into the original butt and are now marrying  for a period of exactly three months.On the 16th December 2011 the cask will be emptied and approximately 650 bottles will be filled with the whisky, at cask strength, at natural colour and with no chill-filtration, by the employees of Glenglassaugh. The very first bottling of Glenglassaugh Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky distilled since the distilleriy`s re-opening in 2008."
2897,Glenglassaugh 2009  Rare Cask Release,"I heard that the recent teenage bottlings of Glenglassaugh was something to look out for. And also I have a weak spot for peated highlanders. Well, it was certainly nice, but this one is not the nicest among them I think. The tobacco note is fairly enjoyable, but it has a slight metallic note in the middle of the palate that is a minus for me. Perhaps the next time.Tropical fruits & stonefruits, simple syrup, slightly minty, mineral, slightly medicinal & smokyTart mango, sea salt caramel, slightly metallic, sesame, some tobacco leaves, vanilla, slightly waxy in textureHefty roasted barley, some barbecue, moderately long, white bread, some chili peppers, slightly metallic"

There are some dried fruits, dried apricots, dried prunes, and Jiayingzi. The bitterness of very fresh orange petals, orange juice, red pomelo and some grapefruit peels slowly appeared.  Taste Palate: It came up with a salty taste of Wujiang mustard, I cracked it. Fortunately, the back taste is much more normal, and the aroma of orchids, cloves, and green peppers burst out. As soon as the flavor changed, I ran directly to the orange petals and orange juice. Cream cake and coconut sugar interspersed in between. The bitterness is more expressed in citrus peel.

2906,Glenglassaugh 2009  Rare Cask Release,"Nice mineral and calcareous intensity to start with. It's almost fruity, on vanilla and apricot, then it's so earthy it's rancid, gypsum, clay, gravel, sea salt. The depth and mellowness of the Oloroso come next, the red fruits blend delicately with minerality and iodine, cranberries, currants, a touch of raspberry. A few charcoal and woody fragrances to finish. The palate is very deep, intense, more on quinces and nuts than on red fruits. Always this very powerful earthy side. Finally, the finish, beefy, a little slap, on varnished wood and cinnamon, saffron. Very nice.

2916,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"I do not like it. The wine barrel comes through very clearly and overall he does not seem very well matured. Especially with younger malts from the wine barrel often have problems, because the fruitiness often comes to me so artificial and extroverted. That's not my thing."
2917,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"Too young and way to much wine cask influence for my taste.Sorry, this doesn't make it."
2918,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"Quite drinkable, but rather young, put on and out of round ...Blackberries, a bit young, grainy, roasted malt, dark overripe plums, plum jam, polish, dark chocolateHere, too, dark fruits, sweet, liquid chocolate, more blackberries and plums, a lot of warmthStrong finish, vinous, dark fruits, the young aspects can be found again, the heat remains a bit but not very long"
2919,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"A very interesting variant for wine barrel finishers. Due to the powerful cask strength and the equally powerful Glassaugh basic tone, a lot of substance remains and develops for a longer stay and later encounters.The wine is immediately in the nose; The ripening in the wine barrel also optically ensures a rust-brown-orange color. Then malt comes in and apparently the dark berries of Glassaugh-New-Make have not been completely lost during the Weinfassreifung. With a little water , the single malt becomes more accessible, more fruity, the malt aromas gain their herbaceous freshness, the harsh vinousness recedes behind a youthful berry sweetness.In the mouth, the young Glassaugh is also vigorous and vinous. That would have been a barrel of rather sour red wine. Now you can also feel the oak, herbs announce themselves, and again the dark currants. The 60% cask strength announces itself on arrival, but subsequently integrates beautifully the different flavors. With a few drops of water , it loses a bit of sharpness and, just as in the nose, the berry sweetness also increases on the palate. That this malt stored in a wine barrel, but remains unmistakable.In the end, the oak bitterness is felt, which complements the tart red wine nuances. The finish with some H2O is less oak-accented, but again fruity."

A nice example of excellently integrated alcohol.Undiluted it shows toffee and caramel, strong vanilla, honey and chocolate cake. In addition a little nut. Very pleasant in the nose, the alcohol is not felt.  With water, it hardly changes, the already known notes are just a bit more airy.Extremely creamy onset. Orange peel, nut and toffee sweets. Honey. Sweet and heavy sherry. Well-integrated alcohol that only warms and does not burn. Herbs and oak come out behind.Long finish, still creamy, but not as sweet as in the beginning due to some oak and tart herbs."
2925,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"  A very young Molot with a strong barrel effect, sherry completely covers the base, it only guessed powerful waves of various sherry derivatives - tropical fruits, plastic, minerals, sharp and juicy chemical shades - all this vividly recalls the previously tried Evolution, so the dominance of the barrel here rather for good, and for reasoning about the modern style of distilleries it is better to choose something refill, bourbon aging.  Restrained, dry, spicy wood, sandalwood, a box for cigars, pipe tobacco, stain, raisins, burnt rusks, leavard, chalk, drying lime plaster.Sharp, powerful, raisins, spicy oak, Indian spices, apricot confiture, pipe tobacco (raw), sharp notes of tropical fruits with a plastic flavor.Light, raisin-apricot, a little oak bitterness, sweet black tea, slightly pu-er, dried mushrooms, light metal sour."
2926,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"Blind tasting of a sample. Very promising at this young age. Reminds me of the 2005 Tamdhus from The Ultimate.Fudge, bramble, candied cherry, cranberry, 'peppernuts' and mint. Despite its chewy profile it stings a bit due to its high ABV.

Malty and lots of hot spices. Feints disappears after a few minutes, transforms more farmy and stablelike - alcohol not very aggressive. Very malty distillate driven nose. Pooridge, cereals, bread dough. Spices: Pepper, chili, ginger and nutmeg - light whiffs of corrosive smoke - pepperspray (how do I know...).With a pinch of water: Nose turns fruity on lemon and grapefruit, malt more in the background. Smoke and hot spices becomes more obvious.Sweet bold citrus attack - lemonpeel, fat malty sensation. Greasy coating mouthfeel. A little green and grassy - bogpeat smoke.

2944,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"Don't quite understand the ratings here. Do we really only evaluate the color and the amount of sherry?  Was that a wet filling with 50 L of residual sherry in it?  Don't get me wrong, I like sherry and I like whisky. Accordingly, this is a great drink, which I don't think has much to do with whisky anymore.  Dear people, if you like this, you can really drink sherry. It's less fashionable than whisky, but if you like this, you can get away cheaper.  Find the rating difficult and here refers to the drink. If I had to rate it as whisky, it would be lower.Sherry in the nose first. No no whisky from the sherry barrel, but normal sherry. Dusty, nutty, sweet, chocolate, forest berries and marzipanIn the mouth, what I feared in the mouth continues: This is sherry sprinkled with whisky. Cocoa powder, hot berries, nutty and a bit musty, bitter-sweet and mintAlcoholic, nutty and of course the sherry sweetness.  Great sherry, but where's the whisky?"
2945,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"HanutaA hand-filled bottle that you can only get at the distillery? That’s a lovely souvenir to take away from a distillery visit. That’s what my buddy Anthony thought when he went to Glenglassaugh last year. A bourbon cask was filled with spirit in 2009, then re-casked to an oloroso sherry cask in 2014. Unique: the ABV noted on the label has two digit after the decimal. Never seen that before.Oi! This is a very pleasant nose indeed. Sweet on dark chocolat, cocoa butter, hazelnut paste, blackberries and marzipan, burnt caramel and Haribo bears on the one hand, but some nice green notes like thyme, basil, parsley and sun dried tomatoes in oil on the other. Yes, this is very good!It is honeysweet on the palate as well, but at the same time quite piquant. I am not so much reminded of fruit now, but more of hazelnut waffles (Hanuta from Ferrero Rocher, anyone?) and nougat, caramel and oak, roasted chestnut and coffee beans. Midpalate a grape pith bitterness emerges. Special, but quite good.The finish is fairly long and mildly drying, but then a sudden fresh leaf of mint kicks in, only to die on Italian espresso.What a ride! This is one schizophrenic Glenglassaugh. Thanks, Anthony!"

Even 30 drops of water can not tame that.  I also have a bit of a guess that this is a finish. As untamed as he is, he can never have spent the full maturity period in a Sherry Hogshead (that would be no surprise to the owners). I'm a fan of spritlastigen whiskys, but if you want to fill it so young, you should have a lot of wood there.  All in all, save your money. For 70 euros are much riper.

With a few drops he does not calm down, but gets a bit more fruity. With more water, it disintegrates unfortunately in the nose, it is beautiful round in the taste, the sherry is clearer with nut flavors  Conclusion: unfortunately bottled too young, give the still 3-5 years time, then should be much better - 79 points"

Sorry, the experiment failed if you ask me.Toffee and caramel chunks, vanilla cream, a lote of pear, white raisin and date. There seems also to be a little bit of wood smoke.It's both raw from the spirit and a bit tannic from the wood. These are quite overpowering, which makes it harder to taste the other elements. It gives a lot of spices, like ginger and nutmeg. Then, there is poached pear, white raisin, toffee, and wood smoke. Rather tongue numbing, I have to say. It's very much on chilli peppers, even horseradish, ginger, and nutmeg. Then there is a little bit of dried fruit, a hint of pear and some wood."

For me, a product that was designed for customers who don't actually like whisky, but drink it because it's in fashion right now. (Please don't take my own opinion personally, I just don't understand where these high ratings come from or why you make so much money for it) my dram is a free addition to a purchase. Is really n great fortified wine.(got some water and a lot of time in the glass, then more water) Lush port wine, fruity jammy but also slight influences of windfall just before it tipped over (fermentation notes, muff) - actually almost only port wine and notes of young, unripened whisky, metallic bitterness, somewhat typical alcoholic pungent - the missing notes almost fade after 20-30 minutes all that remains is port wine on the nosesweet bitter blackberry jam, for cassis I lack fresh acidity and the typical aroma, pleasant bitterness, nice creamy texture - the stuff is not bad, especially on the palate - but that's not whisky for mea lot of liquorice - dominant - that bothers me, a soapy perfume note, salt, tart herbaceous, mint, a little sweet fruit"

Apparent ruby Port notes; red plums, blackberries, fresh and semi dried red grapes, fresh as well as dried red and dark red berries. With time; toffee and nuts. With a little water; cocoa powder and vanilla custard. Packs quite a punch. (89-90p)TASTE: The arrival is fruity and sweet but well balanced by a lovely driness provided by an appropriate amount of wood spiciness and tannins. On the mid palate ruby and tawny port fruitiness, toffee, touches of black pepper and coffee. Super juicy. With a little water the cocoa powder appears here as well, sprinkled on top of some darker chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel. (89-90p)FINISH: The finish is fruity and slightly sweet with just the appropriate amount of nice, ripe and balancing wood tannins. Towards the end some herbal notes appear. Long and warming. (90p)OVERALL: This wine is more about juicy frutiness, spice and power than elegance. It takes no prisoners. You will most probably either love it or hate it. It will benefit quite a lot from being drunk slightly below room temperature (around 16-18°C). If served to warm, a slightly spirity side appears. Takes water well.

Appears quite viscous, with long legs running down the sides of the glass.NOSE: Fairly intense nose dominated by ruby Port notes; winey with fresh and semi dried red grapes, dark plums, red and dark red berries. TASTE: The arrival is both fruity, slightly sweet and nicely drying and tannic, transitioning quite seemlessly to a drier but still winey and fruity impression on the mid palate. Definitely ruby (or VP/LBV) Port driven but quite ssuccessfully so. FINISH: The finish is fruity with (nice/winey) wood tannins, white and black pepper. Fairly long for an 11 YO.OVERALL: Strictly for Port lovers (?). Although the red Port wine cask is dominant, I can sense a nice, clean and sweet underlying spirit. Takes water quite well. I have a suspicion this will develop nicely with some time in the bottle to slowly oxidise. But this is not for refill Bourbon barrel lovers, of that I'm certain. TOTAL SCORE: [Too early to say] points."
2969,Glenglassaugh 2009  Rare Cask Release,"with water: it becomes rounder, calmer, the dark blackberry now partially becomes raspberry and strawberry, it tolerates water very well Conclusion: damn, a damn good port wine barrel whisky, whereby the distillery character is completely lost here. But the dram takes a lot of time and air, the first nose is almost daunting, and the addition of water also takes it to a higher level. If it weren't so difficult to get going at the beginning, there would be 1 point morethe first nose is quite hard, leather, red berries, especially blackberries, mineral, but after a while it becomes sweeter and sweeter, the port completely takes over, fat blackberry jam, some oak and a few cloves, a little salt also comes along into play and the mineral disappears almost completelyfat start, but not particularly oily, blackberry, black currant, forest honey, some leatherquite long and not that sweet at all, the oak is quite present here and conjures up a lot of liquorice and liquorice on the palate"

2972,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"Nose: toffee, coffee, cappuccino, caramel, a little bit of oak, which gets stronger with time, some cocoa. Then a little alcohol & some dried fruit. More a candy than a drink.  Mouth: strong, intense and alcoholic, the nose did not point to it, slightly sour, dried fruit, intense sherry. With water a bit rounder, more oak-accented.  Finish: menthol, oak, dried fruits, bitter-sweet sherry finish.  Conclusion: nice part! Comes over much older than he is. Probably a very active barrel."
2973,Glenglassaugh 2009  Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"It is the Cask 2345, from which I was able to bottle on 12.08.2014 (one of the last?).Very fruity nose, I could identify strawberry and orange. Sweet notes of milk chocolate and caramel as well as wine notes.At first sharp, the alcohol is very clear. Sweet notes dominate, with marzipan, herbs. A touch of salt. Wood notes are hardly recognizable.Very round and mild, again milk chocolate and caramel. Again some salt. Again, no pronounced wood notes. Conclusion: A very nice fresh and fruity Sherry Cask Whisky. 88 points"
2974,Glenglassaugh 2009 Ronnie Lawrence  The Chosen Few,"Thick sherry, abv is hidden, light sour note but mainly dates and prunesBoom, big thick and coating, here the abv pokes through, but the malt and sherry are both powerful and work surprisingly well for it being a 3yr old, it is a sherry/young malt puro without much else tho.Sweet, light tannins, white pepper, grassy"

2976,Glenglassaugh 2009 Ronnie Lawrence  The Chosen Few,"At about the half way point of the bottle, I have to admit that my original score of 83 was too harsh. This baby oxidized very well. Almost no heat on the noise and palate now half way through the bottle. Very well rounded and on the edge of smooth. Which is incredible for such a young whisky. Not overly complex, but much more satisfying and well worth the money. Noise: Dark chocolate, black cherry and vanilla.Palate: Much the same as the noise; dark chocolate, black cherry and vanilla but more os a cherry liqueur. Finish: Medium, warm and soothing.I finished the bottle yesterday and was sad to see it go. My updated rating is a solid 88. Which is much more reflected in the entire bottle experience."
2977,Glenglassaugh 2009 Ronnie Lawrence  The Chosen Few,"Very disappointing. Very hot, no complexity, lacking depth. Not much for as far as tasting notes.My above notes were from testing the first two drams of a brand new bottle.

2979,Glenglassaugh 2009 Ronnie Lawrence  The Chosen Few,"You could add a bit of water and get an even more easy to drink and very sweet whisky. But it really isn't necessary.A really good example that a good whisky doesn't have to be old when it is properly matured in a good cask. This is just superb whisky and fantastically selected by the staff at Glenglassaugh!Bottled at over 60% Vol. and the first impression is NOT dominated by the alcohol content. Very impressive, especially for such a young whisky! Lots of heavy sherry influences with toffee, dark fruits and sweets. Also salty butter and vanilla.Dangerously easy to drink for 60% Vol. alcohol!Sherry sweetness and fruityness, fruit salad and a bit of liquorice.Awesome mouth feeling with a rich and almost thick texture.Not too long as you would expect, hints of oak after the alcohol is gone."

2985,Glenglassaugh 2010  Rare Cask Release,"A 10cl sample was tried. Sufficient has been written about the whisky here. The whisky is really well balanced, especially for this age. I like it very much, even though I'm not that much of a PX fan. I like Oloroso much better. However, this actually only applies to young, predominantly additively matured PX sherry, older maturations are usually not so affected because the long oxidative maturation sets a counterpoint. Fortunately, it is more reminiscent of an old (20 years and more) whisky stored in a PX barrel, which is not only gossipingly sweet but also has many ripe fruit notes and dark (coffee and cocoa) aspects."
2986,Glenglassaugh 2010  Rare Cask Release,"Great success, a sherry that plays the minty / fruity card for my greatest pleasure.first very focused on sherry like all young bodybuilders first fill sherry: nuts, mocha, bitter coffee. But, quickly, it turns out to be mentholated, which breaks down this heaviness that I don't always like, and a cooked fruit side appears: caramelized pineapple, one might think of a rum.The sweet side that I was dreading is not present. It's very fresh, lively and surprisingly fruity, maybe strawberry type. The sherry cask is forgotten to return only in the second half of the mouth with a cocoa / menthol kick that matches perfectly.long, rather on coffee."

2988,Glenglassaugh 2010  Rare Cask Release,"I often find rubbery notes from PX-matured malts to fully enjoy them. However with this 'glassaugh I detect no such defects. Also while it does have strong sweetness it never gets cloying. Tastes more like a quality cream sherry, especially with Oloroso-like nutty notes in the finish. Feels like they used very good sherry for this one.While I feel that it is mostly the cask than the malt I'm tasting, it's such a good cask that I cannot object to it. Such a delight.Raisins, chocolate syrup, molasses, meatyGrilled pineapples, dark brown sugar, slightly meaty, creamy in texture, cocoa powder, espresso, slightly mintyFreshly ground coffee, raisins, quite long, Oloroso-like nuttiness, dark chocolate, slightly minty"
2989,Glenglassaugh 2010  Rare Cask Release,"Actually, based on the color and age, you should think that it is a one-dimensional sherry soup. But far from it. The nose is fantastic, very nicely balanced, with different aromas and the alcohol is very well integrated, no sharpness whatsoever. He looks a lot older. In the mouth a fruit compote with chocolate. The aromas make it into the finish, where they slowly fade away. A great 10 year old whisky from a seemingly excellent barrel."

2998,Glenglassaugh 2010  Edition No. 8,"[September, 2019] I had a dram during a FoSM club blind tasting......and this was by far the worst in the line-up. It is full of flaws and off-notes which makes it hard to drink (for me). What a shame to offer such flawed casks to customers (the FoSM club did not have the chance to check the cask before it was filled). So if you consider to buy a private cask at a distillery either select one with an excellent cask management or negotiate to be able to check the cask by yourself...The colour is yellow gold and the nose is - boah! - full of weird and disgusting off-notes. Cheesy (sweaty socks), sulphurous (matchbox ignition area) and brackish - it is very astonishing that obviously some drinkers enjoy such notes. But this is absolutely okay, if you really do...The taste is about the same - full of flaws with an unpleasant sulphurous spike (burnt fireworks). I am not willing to explore this dram further...The initial mouthfeel is sulphurous-scurfy as is the long finish. After a brave tasting sip this dram went down the drain..."

First, the typical Glenglassaugh floral note dominates with a hint of bitterness and is then replaced by the wonderful, soft, reserved, filigree sweetness of the Sicilian Marsala wine, which remains in the mouth for several minutes after swallowing. I would have estimated this malt to be 15-18 years old. This is how a handfill has to be, exceptional quality, a top barrel."

3025,Glenglassaugh 2012  Rare Cask Release,"A young, powerful but no less tasty single malt from the Glenglassaugh Distillery. Maturation in PX puncheon delivers a good level of sweetness alongside the usual sultanas and dates, balanced with dry oak and tobacco notes and rounded off with fine herbs. The high alcohol content is noticeable and leaves room for the addition of water. I thank deinwhisky.de for the complimentary sample!https://www.whisky-connaisseur.de/2021/06/29/glenglassaugh-9yo-2012-2021-rare-cask-release/Immediately the typical sherry aromas are present with sultanas, dates, sweet caramel, brown sugar and subtle walnut. Over time, a light herbal note develops with sage and a hint of mint. Notes of tobacco and a little coffee can be detected in the background. The alcohol is present but not pungent.Sweet on the palate with sultanas, dates and malt sugar. Warming and creamy mit nutmeg and walnuts. Towards the finish, subtle herbal notes of sage and a hint of tobacco leaves are noticeable.The finish is long lasting with increasingly dry and somewhat bitter notes of tobacco leaf, oak and green walnut. With water: After adding water, more herbal notes come to the fore with mint and sage alongside the sweetness of sultanas and brown sugar, accompanied by significantly more nutty flavours, such as walnut and Brazil nut. The palate continues to be powerful and tingling with a weakened sweetness, along with dry oak, some pepper, walnut and herbal notes of mint and sage. The finish is medium long, dry and slightly bitter with tobacco leaves, walnuts and a hint of espresso."
3026,Glenglassaugh 2012  Rare Cask Release,"The nose is exciting, the rest is quite weak. Virgin Oak or a non-Scottish malt was also typed blind. I can't understand where the sherry barrel is here, definitely a drop that is too woody.Oak, orange peel, fruity, fresh, a lot of oak, also slightly tart, fresh wood, wax, some glue. Over time it becomes more and more beautiful and round in its idiosyncratic nature.Hot, almost alcoholic, peppery, with water only peppery, but also with a certain sweetness and a little vanilla, more pleasant.Pepper, hot, bitter oak only marginal fruitiness, a little creamy vanilla.

3034,Glenglassaugh 2012  Rare Cask Release,"Tasting of a 3cl sample. The 70cl bottle will wait (very little I think).  On the nose, the oloroso is obviously present but not invasive, the yellow fruits (peach of the melocotón type especially, mango) and the cigar box dominate the whole then appear citrus notes (zest). In the mouth we find the nose supported by a dash of powerful pepper. The finish is carried by this same pepper accompanied by mirabelle plum and spices. What I like here is the rather dry dominance of this whisky, a treat to be confirmed with the 70cl which are waiting in my cupboard ..."
3035,Glenglassaugh 2012  Rare Cask Release,"Glenglassaugh is the only distillery under Rachel Barrie's reign I haven't tried anything from yet. Let's skip the core range and go straight to the real deal! On the nose; fairly aggressive, buttery and spicy. Fruity too with apple compote, blueberry, apricot, raisin and grilled pineapple. Quite tame on the sweetness with milk chocolate, marzipan, Werthers Original and cotton candy. Grain, tobacco, pepper, cut grass, roast peanut, beef stock, sherry vinegar and even some smoke and sauerkraut in the back. This goes all over the place, not too impressed. Quite reminiscent to Tamdhu in some aspects. In the mouth; is this really almost 59%? I would have given this 50% at most. Well, on to how it tastes: A lot more in balance than the nose, that's something I don't encounter often. Apple, raisin, apricot, bloodorange and fig. Some more focus on the fruit and that's a good thing. Assorted chocolate, jaffa cake, salted caramel, licorice and cherry cola. Further on cream sherry, vanilla, brown sugar, ginger, pepper and walnut. That was impressive though! Finish is long for a young malt like this. Cherry cola, milk chocolate, malt and salted pistacchio.Afraid this was going nowhere after the nose, it showed remarkable balance on the palate. Good sherry influence, not too much. I think this was bottled just in time otherwise the cask would have taken over.. The nose could be better but what do we expect at 7 years of age? Based on a sample."

Much of the same, doesn't develop that much. It's perhaps a bit more honeyed.Pleasant, long, not drying. Ginger, cinnamon, honey and rich toffee. "

Nose: this one                                             is more polished and probably more                                             elegant but the general profile is                                             pretty close to the 1983’s.                                             Light, moderately fragrant, pleasantly                                             flowery and honeyed. More vanilla                                             as well, and also notes of apple pie,                                             strawberry pie and butterscotch, fresh                                             butter and just a little sawdust.                                             The oakiness grows bigger over time                                             (quite some cinnamon and a little                                             mint). Mouth: once again we find the                                             same profile as with the 1983, only                                             much bigger this time and rather fruitier                                             too, with notes of peppered pear drops,                                             should that exist. Gets then frankly                                             grassy and malty, with the oak singing                                             rather loud.

3080,Glenglassaugh 30-year-old,"[August, 2018]  When I started my whisky life back in the nineties no one noticed Glenglassaugh despite some very fine releases out there - they all went for cheap bucks to us drinkers, fortunately.  This changed when the new owners started to release very pricey editions:  All of a sudden many people jumped on that train and praised this distillery from then on (sadly, as the prices went into ""undrinkable"" regions).  But from time to time I indulge in a sample of one of the new releases…...and I do not regret it!  This is a perfect example of a delicate and impressive old style matured sherry whisky that offers not much of Glenglassaugh but a delicious and very, very quaffable clean sherry profile instead.  Is the price justified?  Several years ago I would have stated ""not"" but the ongoing whisky boom drives price points higher year by year.  Personally I think, this dram is worth around 250 to 300 Euro in 2018 (unfortunately) - so if you do not own old stocks and you want to explore such a fine sherry profile I recommend to go for this edition...The colour is chestnutoloroso sherry and the nose offers a fine old-style sherry profile with all the great sherry-induced aromas in a firm but never too heavy wooden structure.  Not sure if much of the Glenglassaugh spirit characteristics come through but who needs this if the sherry profile is such excellent.  By the way, the first nose right after serving the dram out of the bottle is the best - so sniff it immediately and do not wait until it ""breathed"" away the boldness...The taste is layered on the different sherry flavours starting with sweet winey notes followed by chocolatey (both dark and milk) and fruity (oranges, plums, apricots) flavours before the raisins, spices and nuts kick in.  The wood is always present but it stays generously in the background and provides just the ""rhythm section"" for all the solo flavours on the tongue's stage.  No flaw (and no sulphur, hallelujah!) or off-note that I can find, all is simply delicious and nicely chewable.  Water is not needed but does no harm either (the nose gets more weakish but the taste improves somewhat) - I suggest to drink it neat.The dram arrives warming in the mouth with a minor coating effect (I hoped for more) and a little astringent moment (tannins) that is not distracting at all.  The finish is of medium length with increasing wooden notes that do not get bitter, fortunately.  There are some espresso flavours that pop up (not the dark roasted ones, rather a light or medium roast) and vanish what is quite interesting to follow.  No bitter or astringent moments here what is great but not usual with such long matured heavily sherried drams."
3081,Glenglassaugh 30-year-old,"Nice drop. After my first tasting with another sample months ago I actually had enough, but the many very good notes have moved me to give the glass eye a second chance. Harmonious, intense malt, but still somewhat watery - the 42% stop ... with a few percent more sure a real bank.Wonderful sweet fruity sherry nose - orange, burnt caramel, leather, sweet tobacco, plums, cherries, baked apple, a huge pile of raisins, mint, blueberries, dark honey, almonds, with milk chocolate and after a while Maggie's cabbage, liquorice and furniture polishoily, sweet, spicy, great mouthfeel - orange, plum, baked apple, many raisins, dark chocolate, espresso, liquorice, balsamic, mint, tobacco and leather notes, with hazelnuts and walnuts and many spices, cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, a hint Curry, pepper, a little salt, dark forest honey and again the burnt caramel - all very harmonious and wonderfully intense, but unfortunately also a bit waterymedium-long, raisins, liquorice and espresso remain the longest, a hint of eucalyptus comes around the corner ..."
3082,Glenglassaugh 30-year-old,"I had great expectations and was rewarded. This malt has a unicorn character. A bottle that I like a lot and the content is a revelation. Direct hit. Fact: The formula for this whisky is not from our time. One thing becomes clear. If you want to know how the art of whisky conjured up 30 years ago, you should get a sample quickly, as long as this bottled dream is still affordable. I ordered one ""immediately"". Get good price. Lucky. A satisfied thank you goes out to André from Whisky Evening for the extra large sample.The nose and the whisky first need TIME. Then the window of the world of sherry ripening of all first-class goods opens. Fruity and yet floral. Fruit cake and notes of fine wood. Then beeswax, light leather and spices. Wow. A fine mixture of tropical fruitiness and elegant sherry. Often sniffed in front of me, the thought of a cognac whisky occurs to me. Training takes place here at the same time. How can sherry caress the nose with clean and clever processes, delicate and complex, without appearing single-track. Awesome!Oily and soft, orange peel spreads spicy and tingling all over the mouth without becoming obtrusive. In several waves everything becomes noticeable that one can dream of a sherry maturation. The entire barrel management becomes clear here, without the New Make having to slander its origins. A dram that you can enjoy in your mouth for a long time. At the transition, there is now fine pipe tobacco in a leather pouch with delicate liquorice and chocolate notes. Everything accompanied by dancing tannins on the tongue. A dream in a glass.What remains for a long time is the memory of Ritter Sport grape nut and it always comes back with coffee notes in a class of their own. A clean finish with no rough edges and that's exactly the point. Pour, sit back and enjoy in peace and quiet what a great hobby I can afford without worries. With such drams ... I feel the privilege. Thanks to Glenglassaugh for donating this first class spirit and selected unicorn barrels. A whisky that seduces without being too pretentious! A master piece."
3083,Glenglassaugh 30-year-old,"In the large (Bordeaux) red wine glass of Glenglassaugh smells even rounder after 20 to 30 minutes, the alcohol is barely perceptible, the Antrunk as warm as intense, then the whisky acts like heavy old wine. In Nosingglas the 30-year-old is a bit sharper and more focused.  After another hour he becomes more concentrated in the red wine glass, sharper. So swing again and aerate. Then the whisky opens again and it comes leather, dark fruit and the much-cited library smell of old books and leather chairs. The note of a connoisseur was worth gold: In old and complex whiskys, the breathing in and pays off from the red wine glass pays off."
3084,Glenglassaugh 30-year-old,"One of the best whiskys I have ever enjoyed and compared.Very sweet, sherry, light oak, ripe fruit, just great.The full elegant sherry note, impressive sweetness including aromas of vanilla pod. 30 years in the barrel also have an effect. And, sure, the knowledge about it too. No trace bitter. A harmonic genius, not to say a harmoniemonster of the most pleasant kind.Medium long, the oak becomes stronger, but never bitter; she is simply there and where she should be."
3085,Glenglassaugh 30-year-old,"Many months of oxidation have made the uncorked Glenglassaugh better and better for my taste. Simply great. Our 2016 Glenglassaugh 30 offers, from the style glass enjoyed, initially a great, waxy honey sweetness in the nose. Very heavy, vinous sherry notes follow, as well as vanilla sugar and oak spice, as well as these ideally complementing, ripe fruit notes, focusing black cherries (jam) and oranges (nectar). Almond flavors complete the flavor profile. Simply great, especially since the malt is already open so long. Exceptionally soft, yet intense and very tasteful, I would like to say. A prime example of how even close to the 'holy' 40% limit is still full of flavor possible. The sweet vanilla and the bouquet of strong sherry aromas are impressive. Overall, the malt lives from its balanced maturity and almost proverbial elegance. The, how could it be otherwise, very successful aftertaste is heralded with very spicy fine, fruity-oaky flavors - the circle to the nose closes perfectly.  Such a long-lived Glenglassaugh from the 1980s, burned shortly before the long-term closure from 1986, is just a very fine thing. Of course, there are even better, mostly barely more to be found individual drums in the market, no question. Likewise, however, in my experience, also less successful representatives. Which at the general (very) high level of the old Glenglassaugh, especially from the 1970s, already means something.  Further notes and reviews on Facebook at #Maltkanzlei"

3112,Glenglassaugh 30-year-old,"Brilliant style. Something complex and unique. Would love to know if there is a recharred barrel or two in the mix, because the nose suggests such to me at least. Billy walker was very big on cask management after all.Initially hints of virgin oak and sugar cane juice. Blueberry pie, mapple sirup-drizzled raspberries, Werther‘s Originals. What a fantastic nose! A vatting of recharred oak and good old refill wood? Perhaps. The 42% do not seem too weak in the slightest here. Killer style of whisky!Nope! Still not too weak. This is electric! Salivating, juicy, metholated cooling sensation and warmth at the same time. Blueberries turn to poached peaches and palm sugar. Then black currant, plums, and medjool dates. Everything is interwoven well here, with a perfumed backdrop that I can‘t quite place. Neither rose water nor lavender, but somewhere intbetween. Turkish delight with a touch of orange blossom bitters?Medium. Blueberries merge into oranges, and oranges into dark chocolate. Good length for 42%, but the casks are carrying it to the finish line."

The whisky is quite tasty, but not worth such a high price for me due to the restrained flavors."

This vase has everything: apples, peaches, apricots, mangoes, oranges, and a little early picked tangerine. All the fruits are fresh, the smells are bright, the balance is excellent, nothing dominates, but only changes. Some baked cupcake.The taste of all the fruits listed above, to which were added candied fruits and dried mango, pomelo, cookies served with coffee.The aftertaste is long, fruity, confectionary, velvety, rounded, bright."

Colour:  full gold. Nose: superb. All on honeycomb, flowers, milk chocolate and fruit  jams, mainly plums and apricots. Some mango chutney too. Frankly, this nose is  brilliant. With water: orgasmic honey and ripe fruits style. Mouth (neat): a  fruit bomb, pretty much in the Caperdonich 1972 style. I’m sure you see what I  mean. Honeys, stewed fruits, jams, a little cough syrup and just the right  amount of pepper, nutmeg and cloves. With water: deliciously citrusy now. Takes  water like a swimming champ. Amazing freshness. Finish: medium long, with more  pepper and other spices from the wood, as almost always. Maybe something  slightly sourish but nothing important. Comments: terrifically complex, fresh  and fruity  "

3129,Glenglassaugh 40-year-old  Crystal Decanter,"Whisky characteristics from the Certificate of Authenticity:Nose: A strong powerful nose that begins with the aroma of geen apples falling to earth onto wet moss and grass. This gives way to a medley of boiled fruit sweets. Despite its complexity, hints of rasberries, blackberries and hints of ripe banana emerge. Finally, the refined sherry notes of sultanas, fruit cake and rich creamy fudge take over.Palate: The rich sherry flavours combine with the boiled fruits to give an incredibly powerful yet complex whisky. The original distillery character is still surprisingly evident despite this whisky´s great age.Finish: A long and consistent finish leaves the freshness of the Granny Smiths apples on the palate. This is a very powerful whisky very well suited to after dinner sipping."
3130,Glenglassaugh 40-year-old  Crystal Decanter,"Colour: Amber.Nose: Strong sherry notes (more pronouced than that of the 30 YO), heavier, more on raisin, figs and clove.Taste: Rich, spicy, getting slightly tannic, on light grassy notes, cumin, dried fruits and orange peel. The finish is long, mellow, creamy, on dried fruits, leather and with some chocolate.General Impression: Another very good whisky from Glenglassaugh, with a strong sherry influence and showing some traces of age. A serious competitor for other heavily sherried  whiskies closer to the Spey river.http://www.whisky-news.com/En/tasting13.html#11dec09  "

Nose: very fragrant, starting on precious wood, raisins and hints of camphor, all that working in sync. Pretty perfect! Goes on with hints of metal polish and damp earth and then many cooked and dried tropical fruits (not fresh). Papayas, pineapples, longans… Gets finally much more leathery and ‘tertiary’, with hints of beef jerky and parsley, even a bit of garlic. Pine resin. A very, very complex old Glenglassaugh! Beautiful. Mouth: a very rich oakiness at first sipping, but an elegant one. A lot of bitter chocolate, various fruit jellies and jams (strawberries first), some vanilla, various herbal teas (rosehip, chamomile, lime tree blossom), and a wide combination of spices including cloves, cardamom, black pepper, carvi and cinnamon (lots). Develops on loads of dark chocolate and coffee beans plus notes of cough syrup. Very ‘torrefied’. Finish: long, spicy, quite tannic but not excessively so. Quite some oranges in the aftertaste. Comments: a 40yo that’s still rather nervous and ‘vibrant’. Excellent and, above all, not too oaky. I like it better than the 30yo – am I normal?  "

3135,Glenglassaugh 40-year-old,"Appearance: Deep gold.Nose: Olorosso in perfectly aged oak beckons: there are Medjool dates, maple walnut ice cream, bananas foster, cracked old leather-bound books, hints of violet–which come and go–raspberries, malted milk balls, an impression of sealing wax…and, last but not least, a phantom note of whole cluster Pinot noir grapes dried in the bottom of a wine glass.Palate: Delicate syrups roll over the tongue without feeling oily, almost as though it evaporates in media res. However, there is no alcohol burn. To say this dram is smooth would be something of an understatement. I love how the marriage between oak, whisky, and sherry has been consummated over forty long years–a “beckoning fair one,” indeed.The Oloroso influence seems rather dry in the mouth, evoking jammy figs, apricots, plums, rhubarb. Macadamia nuts are cradled by a ubiquitous yet unimposing oak foundation, which isn’t bitter in the least. The sample in my glass is three quarters gone now. As my mouth and brain have grown accustomed to the broth, I’m happy to report lightly roasted coffee beans, along with Abuelita Mexican hot chocolate. There even seems to be a touch of steamed rice milk with almond syrup. Marvelous, just marvelous.Finish: Well, the denouement is not what I would call long. In fact, this whisky’s finish is barely medium in length. But a woody-marshmallowy-sweet impression haunts the mouth in the best of ways. I might also add that my dram is really “neat.” By this, I mean to say that a light sprinkling of water does nothing to improve the quality, the depth, or the complexity. Rallfy Mitchell might disagree, with teaspoon in hand, but I really must hold my ground. Lovely stuff–this–at full strength, thank you very much.Final ThoughtsI suppose the main drawback to this Glenglassaugh 40-Year-Old lies in the fact that it doesn’t present much in the way of a challenge. It’s exceedingly agreeable, smooth, and civilized. The finish is medium-short, and sweet as pie. I’ve read about previous 40-year-olds, released by Glenglassaugh, that sounded far more complex, offering everything from hints of metal polish to pineapple glazed ham.In other words, there are no savory or industrial influences in this 42.5% bottling. If I were angling to spend upwards of $1,300 on a whisky, I might want a bit more in the way of a challenge. But that’s me. I’m sure that plenty of folks with pockets that deep would rather just sip a delicious dram and think about other things. (Speaking of which . . . in my review of the Springbank 16-Year-Old Local Barley, you will find a discussion of forty-plus-year-old Springbank releases that contain both savory and industrial notes, by the way.)I also find it interesting that the Glenglassaugh 40-Year-Old is quite a bit lighter in color than the 30-Year-Old. I guess the younger spirit hails from casks with more sherry left in the wood? Darker isn’t always better, however. That’s worth remembering, especially in a very old spirit that has been allowed to retain a decent amount of distillery character.It’s also worth mentioning that Glenglassaugh has released two batches of venerable old single malts. The first batch includes eight whiskies that range from 28 to 45 years old. The second batch also consists of eight releases, this bunch ranging from 36-42 years old. All of them are reputed to be “fruit bombs.” I didn’t see anything on Glenglassaugh’s website, or in any related whisky reviews online, which pointed to much in the way of savory notes, spicy notes, or industrial notes.For a distillery that died and came back from the dead more times than I can count, Glenglassaugh sure created a lot of well mannered “offspring.” I’m sure that these bottled spirits are more than happy to “speak their names,” if one holds a glass to one’s ear. They have all the charm of the Belle at the Ball, rather than the Bad Boy who was mothballed.As for the secret history of an “undead” distillery, I’m relieved to say that this yarn has a happy ending, thanks to Benriach. Slainte mhath. May the river, the tide, and good spirits, rise with you. I have yet to try any of the younger NAS core offerings, but they seem intriguing. Perhaps one or two might stray into the realm of spicy, savory, and industrial.On the other hand, I’m a sucker for older age statement whiskies that cover all three bases, and then tag home plate (sweet). For me, that sort of complexity is a Babe Ruth-style home run, at least when it’s done right. Judging by the reviews I’ve seen of the discontinued 40 Year Old 44.6% offering, that seems to have been the case. The darkly dangerous broth is rumored to contain spices, smoked meats, and plenty of succulent fruits, as well as chocolaty goodness. Ah, well. The grass is always greener. Especially when the late great Jim Murray tantalizes you with 96 points from beyond the grave. That’s right. A past year of his Whisky Bible gave it one of the highest scores of all time."

A staggering 40YO from a remote coastal distillery.N- After 40years of slow nurturing in the casks, this one need times and patience to let it breath to reach fullness in the glass. Stiff and restricts at the beginning as anticipated, but affection grows with the arrival of natural fine dates and raisins oak fragrant. Strawberry fondant, semi moist coarse sugar coated dehydrated nutmeg and apricot, bright liquorice shines at tail. (93/23)P- Pronounce oak influence the liquid with doses of black tea, tannin, berries compote with floral essence. Lightly bitterly sweet transit to mellow sourness, and feel more of coffee bean now than black tea. (89/22)F- Medium, feel the lack of stamina here. Smooth with substances, chewy ripe tannin without the bites. Age-y dry elegantly. (87/21)B/B- 87/21 Perhaps, weakened by the strength.

Wine gum, mango, passion fruit, raisins, dried apricot, sweetened peaches and a large portion of cream caramel candies, slightly vinous, the oak is super well integrated and picks up the malt with a great spice (cinnamon and a few cloves and licorice) on the next level. Again and again, something maritime, salty, shines through. Everything is very complex, well interwoven and very harmonious and he is also very strong despite the only 42.5%  Taste: strong onset, great mouthfeel. Here, the sherry dominates stronger, nutty, almonds, dried fruit, some milk chocolate, oak, cinnamon and liquorice  Finish: long, it flows like crude oil down the throat, fruity with a lot of marzipan, cherries, the oak is also clear, but not overpowering and above all without bitterness, after a while hazelnuts, and licorice notes are added.

3154,Glenglassaugh 43-year-old  Miniature - Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"A great whisky for anyone who likes that fruity style of old, but buyer beware, these Glenglassaugh minis seem to have a screwcap that can come loose even with the plastic seal intact, in which case some of that metallic/soapy ""mini taint"" (too much air into a small bottle through a metal cap) will be present.Tasting 3 different GG minis (37yo, this, and 44yo), this one came last, but we're almost splitting hairs, since I scored them 92, 93, and 94 points. The low ABV shows a bit in the finish, but otherwise I would've put this one at 93 too.Comparing this to the 37 and 44yo minis, this one's close to the 37, while the 44 is in a place all its own. Here we have gentle, bright fruitiness (contrasted to the 37yo's similar but more acidic nose), with a wisp of chlorine, and this fatty old oak smell I call ""chess pieces"" because it reminds me of a chess set my friend had when I was a kid. I usually find that note in early 1980s or older Glenfarclas, and love it dearly, so it's great to find it here. In total the nose is not complex, but it's truly seductive.Feels more robust than the 37 does neat, but the 37 becomes rather similar with enough water. Honeyed, with bright tropical fruit notes everywhere. Neither too sweet nor too bitter, the balance is perfect, but the body is just a smidgen flabby compared to the 37 and the 44, so you do feel the ABV a bit. Still, this one has not at all gone over.Waxy, slightly musty, with a ripe fruitiness. Long, but not as vivid as the 37 and the 44, probably due to the low %. No tannin beasts lurking here, just joy."

3157,Glenglassaugh 44-year-old  Miniature - Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"This is thus far the best Glenglassaugh I have encountered and all in all in the top five of the malts I have tasted. Just a beauty.Rumraisin-icecream, really good old cognac, a bit of glue in the beginning that starts little by little to open up a choir of tropical fruit: ripe mango, kiwi, passion fruit, different kinds of citrus-fruits as if mixed with Indian sugar, such is the width and depth of the unbelievably fresh sweetness. A little bit of Molkosan and sour apple-candy that (for some odd reason) is very close to some of my favorite Bunna sherry-classics, JM 20 1979 & DL 37 1974.The freshness! Almost perfect old oak that is fruity, sweet and sour in just the right combination. Waxiness, cognac-flambeed fruits, maple-syrup (a taste in whisky that I just love), mocha, different kinds of nuts, sacher-cake and an endless variety of delicious fruits.Long and strong on candlewax, fruits and sweet malt."
3158,Glenglassaugh 44-year-old  Miniature - Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"Magnificent. A masterpiece of whisky.Tasted with Balblair 1990-2016 (86 pts.), Benrinnes 24yo 1991 cask 090508 (89), and Glenglassaugh 26yo Rare Casks 200ml (85).I really liked the Glenglassaugh 43yo Rare Casks 200ml I tasted a few months ago (92 pts.), but this mini is better.Very close to a rich, oaky cognac, but more robust. Smells of old cellos, old wine casks, and of tropical fruit. Perfection, really. The ABV bites back a bit neat, but it's still awesome. There's tropical fruit everywhere, accompanied by this luxurious aged oak note. Resinous, present, and rich body. Give it some time and a bit of water though, because the way it integrates those two just makes everything about it a notch or two better. Not a whisky for people in a hurry, but isn't that almost always the case with over 40yo drams?A long cascade of fruitiness with some herbal touches."
3159,Glenglassaugh 44-year-old  Miniature - Hand Bottled at the Distillery,"It seems that this is no single cask bottling, but rather a vatting of the remains from a number of old single casks, as the Product Information states:""A specially selected number of single cask bottlings, all of which have been aged for a minimum of 40 years are carefully selected to ensure that their nose and palate are a true representation of the Glenglassaugh standard.The result is a rather complex malt whisky with rich sherry overtones that are truly reminiscent of rich fruit cake."""

Something interesting, pineapple-citrus in places makes its way, but it is so fragmented that it does not change the picture as a whole. The taste is not so bad, but the fragrance evokes memories of the 90's, the faded vodka in the entrance, moonshine in the garden ... okay, let's not talk about the sad, aftertaste, alas, also not happy with its ersatz-sugariness. Conclusion - you can drink, but why?Juicy and powerful smell of grain moonshine, alcohol, light rubber tones, sweetness in the background, pineapples, mineral tones, but moonshine prevails.  A sharp wave of red pepper, with the old, half-weathered, a little wood, sweetness, a little pineapple, kumquats, on the whole poorly, something breaks through, but there is no whole picture.Short, sweet, and the sweetness is not sugar, and some sugar substitute - artificial, chemical."

It seems that there are various batches, some bearing Months and bottle numbers and some not. This one is numbered. It’s not exactly a first as Samaroli already had newmake (Longrow) quite some years ago, Kilchoman too and maybe others. Colour: as white as vodka. Nose: well well well, this reminds us of the many visits we did at Scottish distilleries, minus the distilleries ;-). What’s sure is that it’s very clean spirit, not extravagantly fruity but fresh and certainly not beer-ish nor feinty. It’s not aromatically complex and it’s hard to come up with proper descriptors, all I can say is that it’s pleasant. Very faint smokiness and just tiny-wee hints of ham and soap. With water: a little more grass and mash but it’s still not beer-ish. Extremely clean. Mouth (neat): more fruits than on the nose. Raspberry jam, Jell-O, tinned pineapples and Haribo bears, all that soaked in white rum. Better than it sounds ;-). With water: more of the same plus notes of pears. Finish: medium long, clean, very fruity. Just a little beer in the aftertaste. Comments: we won’t comment on the meaning of such a bottle, after all we’re only into whisky tasting (not commenting) on this blog, which isn’t even a true blog by the way. What’s sure is that it’s probably the very best vodka ever, even better than the malt vodkas that one can find here and there. I was ready to smash this bottling because it looked like a pure marketing stunt but I must say I really enjoyed it. Better than many matured malts in my book!"

3198,Glenglassaugh New Spirit  The Spirit Drink that blushes to speak its name,"Following the release of ‘The Spirit Drink that dare not speak its name’ (July’s Whisky of the Month), the team at Glenglassaugh distillery on the Moray Firth coast has now released a version of ‘new make’ which has been matured in former Californian red wine casks for six months. Managing director Stuart Nickerson says that “I have never seen or tasted spirit like this and its development has been enormously exciting. We have a number of other exciting maturation projects underway, but the effect of these casks is so dramtic that we wanted to use the spirit to celebrate our first six months of production.” as we shall call it for the sake of brevity, looks disconcertingly like mouthwash, although the producers prefer to call it “…a dramtic rosé hue,” but if you plan to gargle with this, we advise that you swallow rather than spit. There is an initial aroma of yeast, followed by intense red berry fruitiness and a hint of spicy honey. Underlying yeast notes persist. Sweet and spicy on the palate, then drying quite insistently to a medium length, mashy and slightly metallic finish. Best drank neat rather than diluted with water, but the producers also suggest mixing it with cranberry or pomegranate juice, or cream soda and ice"

3218,Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated,"For me this is great whisky. I was lucky enough to be given a couple of bottles of private cask Glenglassaugh - 5yr old peated in a  quarter cask made up from a sherry butt. I'm told Glenglassaugh was actually quite desperate to buy the cask back! We bought a bottle of this to compare an official bottling. The private bottling was at cask strength so the comparison was a little limited. However - like the Private Cask, the smoke profile on this is really up my street. Its like the browned cake soaked paper that protects a Christmas cake - the smell that wafts from the oven as it catches but before it turns bitter. This whisky is rich and rounded. At points in it evolution it's distinctly like Tiramisu, the Italian coffee liqueur cake soaked base. I want to give it 90, but perhaps 89.5 would be fairer. it could do with being a touch higher abv - say 47% or even 50% - Hell they should just knock out individual peated octaves at cask strength. If they do it would be top of my wishlist."
3219,Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated,"A revisit after the bottle been sitting half full for a month.Putting in a note because I think it has changed more than what I am used to in the average bottle.The peat is more Highlandish now, more heathery rich moss type.Still very gentle but it feels fuller from the get go.Nutty-stuff from the nose also present on palette from midway and into the end.All in all a rather positive evolvement."
3220,Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated,"First sip made me doubtfull, but this grows on you.Just the right ballance between sweet and smoke, and presented at a dangerously easy drinkable 44%."
3221,Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated,"Impressive for something that by logic can't be more than 8 years old.Very sweet and quite peaty.Right after pouring it's an unusual Highland peat, coastal, almost Islay. But it mellows down and becomes more faint rather quickly.Rich on dark red fruits, plums, mild sherry notes, some nuts.Light floral. Fresh soft ginger.Nice and interesting nose.Initial arrival feels very light, but gets a boost by some fresh ground pepper, not the hot feeling but rather the pure taste. Followed by a wave of peat and sweetness.Medium lenght on gingerbread with honey, mild peat and some pepper returning at the very end."
3222,Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated,"Uncomplicated, enjoyable drink with unfortunately higher price than would be idealGingerbread, of course, a lot of woody tones, including oakiness, vanilla, apple compote with cinnamon, brown sugar and light peat. A cumbersome, smoothed smell.Lots of vanilla, coffee, tiramisu. A few apricots in the background combined with fine peat and pepper spice.Again vanilla, tiramisu, woody tones. The conclusion is warm and drying with a dose of peat."
3223,Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated,"- blind tasting -  In the nose I have directly cold smoke, orange, some leather, also a bit biting, tends to be young, reminiscent of the smell but the Octomore 7.2 in the light version (I would say ""blind""). On the palate then very mild, the smoke is there, but not very strong. A cask strength I never have here and never in the glass. Maybe not 43% more. Advantage of such a diluted bottling, it does not burn in the throat - otherwise I have the oranges, a touch of oak and of course the cold smoke. In the finish, the malt is also rather short. Slightly sweet on the cheeks. It could be a rather young guy from a UA. Presumably in the Hogshead ... From the balance, the Malt is certainly okay, because he summarizes easy-drinking therefore comes. A good smoke entry-level whisky? In the end, however, the drinking strength is too low for me and would have required 5-6% more vol power. Nevertheless, a good drinkable malt, where you do not have to worry too much."

3225,Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated,"The same applies here as to his Classic brother. Only the beautiful smoke / peat note makes this whisky a point better. A great nose is not everything.Spicy smoke, first nice and greasy, then goes into cow dung. But then the mild smoke will gently float in the glass, greasy, heavy, sweet (as in Springbank 15). In addition, heavy honey sweetness, juicy pear, heather. The nose is greatHere, too, a mild onset, juicy, sweet smoke dominates, even here little to no fruitiness, honey, nutsthe smoke remains, but otherwise only a tiny bit of oak bitterness at the end.

Finish is somewhat astringent... not really balanced between nose, taste and finish."
3243,Glenglassaugh Peated - Port Wood Finish  Wood Finish Series,"Again very sweet the colleague, but coupled with the smoke as a counterpole he likes me best of the three previously tried the Wood Finish series.  I could already imagine the combination with smoke at the unpeated port wood and think that the malt is really good.First pleasant, not too intrusive smoke, then the port. Similar to the unpeated with red fruits, vanilla, cinnamon, a touch of mint, light letherness, some pepper.Right in the mouth. A beautiful interplay of fruity sweetness with strawberries and other red berries and the smoke that is here, if it is always penetrating, clearer. Slightly scratchy but paired with the sweet very pleasant.When swallowing first creamy sweet, vanilla, red fruits, the smoke gives the conclusion and lingers with the residual sweetness."

No more tobacco flavor.slightly bitter finish, which disappears fairly quickly. a dry mouthfeel remains.

The red fruits look very artificial and are most reminiscent of rhubarb compote, even the very young age you notice the malt clearly, he is sprightly and unbalanced, a lot of white pepper. In the background, some pineapple and caramel fight through again and again  Taste: a very strong, alcoholic start with the white pepper. But then there is some sweetness from the Portfass, also caramel, vanilla and a decent portion of wood is added  Finish: it's gone very fast, a very short finish. The aromas of the taste with pepper, red fruits and caramel, and vanilla with oak are repeated  with water: water is quite good, amazingly it does not break down like many other young whisky, the peppery pungency disappears.  Conclusion: Not the big litter, too young and a port wine barrel that reminds rather of sour red wine.

Nose: excuse me but ‘ouch’. It smells more or less like a ‘not too clean’ raspberry eau-de-vie. What’s more, the combination of the wine and the new make make the whole much farmier than straight new make. Notes of cured ham, redcurrant jelly and cow stable. Highly unusual indeed! Mouth: well, we’re even more on eau-de-vie. Say a 50/50 mix of raspberry eau-de-vie and Zubrovska (buffalo grass vodka). It’s not bad, but is it for malt drinkers? Maybe not… Finish: rather long, with a lot of raspberry in the aftertaste. Comments: of course I have nothing against experimentation but just like the helicopter-bicycle, not sure the future is bright for such gimmicky combos. Better buy a good white eau-de-vie, it’ll be cheaper. Now maybe this ought to be drunk chilled? And funny it is.  "

3359,Glengoyne 21-year-old  Unhurried Since 1833,"Very poor indeed. Seems like an entirely category of spirits compared to its previous incarnation.There is actually no mention of first fill sherry casks on the packaging and I suspect the whisky is no longer aged in such casks. It is poor and a waste of money. Harsh, dry and thin, has a pleasant sweetness but it's almost as if the whole thing has been diluted. Tastes more like a grain whisky actually."
3360,Glengoyne 21-year-old  Unhurried Since 1833,"Hm.. still good to very good malt. Seems to me the sherry is less prominent, probably casking is a bit different than a few years back. Has a wonderful 90 p. nose with lots to discover, but a hard time to to deliver the nose on the palate and finish. No off notes imho, but lacks intensity a bit. Recent price hike to 120+ EUR does not help, unfortunately."
3361,Glengoyne 21-year-old  Unhurried Since 1833,"I get more light tropical fruits than dark sherry notes. Yet the wood bitterness which comes with the old age is noticable. Tastes like european oak to me, but not first fill sherry. A good whisky, but not compariable to its predecessor. If you want a good PLV and more sherry influence, maybe take a look at the Arran 18."

In addition, some vanilla, fruit and gentle wood spice. Unfortunately, due to the dilution to the very low 43%, it seems a bit powerless to me as a connoisseur with a keg strength affinity and also does not have the depth that I would have actually hoped for at 21 years old. Too bad.Sherry-accentuated: concentrated dark PX sweetness, slightly sweet teryaki sauce and a whole load of roasted hazelnuts and macadamias. Fig jam and a few soft plums too. A little bit of an old lexicon. Delicate sweet and fruity notes, in the direction of vanilla and apricot macarons. I also have to think of sweet oranges. In addition, a pleasant, subtle fennel spice. Herbal honey. A nicely composed nose, the only thing I would like is a little more (alcohol) strength.He rears up a little at first, but then quickly looks a bit watered down. Unfortunately. Sour-tart, nutty Palo Cortado sounds like it. Dark chocolate. Red pepper. But also some clear coconut water.Vanilla. Again in the direction of dry Palo Cortado. Gentle wood flavor. Candied orange peel was now added to the dark chocolate. Some leather also flashes. Unfortunately he says goodbye very quickly, there are hints of licorice and cloves. Very dry."

3387,Glenlivet 12-year-old  The Original Stories - Licensed Dram,"This is a (small) step up from last year's Glenlivet 12 Years Illicit Still. In my book at least.There's lots of fudge, some honey and touches of hazelnut. That's followed by strawberry jam and port-stewed pears, but also whiffs of almonds and liquorice. Finally a tinge of orange zest and peaches.A creamy mouthfeel and a sweet, honeyed arrival. First impression is malty, somewhat dry and nutty, and a bit of a spicy punch. Think white pepper, ginger and cloves. Also some herbal notes, but then finally apple peel and melon.Lingering notes of crushed mint and sage. Ending on sweeter notes of honey and processed sugar."
3388,Glenlivet 12-year-old  The Original Stories - Licensed Dram,"I would say: very good and very tasty! In contrast to the Illicit, less alcoholic hot. The 48% pushed me too hard on some days. Both in the nose and in the taste. I think this one got more Virgin Oak for that. Means: I couldn't keep it in my mouth for so long, otherwise the oak would bunch up completely. Tasting yesterday went something like this: ""Oh, it smells good. Nice color! Whether it was re-colored? Well, try a sip .... Nice mouthfeel, nice oily .... Oh wow, what an oak load, better swallow it quickly. ... Ahh very tasty! I'll take another sip =) "" Two WSD are already out of the sample and as soon as it is reasonably available on the German mark, I would strike."
3389,Glenlivet 12-year-old  The Original Stories - Licensed Dram,"On the first opening it totally smelled like Bourbon whisky. Only after a few minutes, and now on the second opening the dram 'transformed' into Scotch on the nose. Funny!Other than that this one seems more mature than the Illicit Still in regards to added wood aromas. Think I read sth about virgin oak being involved at some point in the maturation process this time around. That would fit the impression. This one also seems a bit less biting on inital opening, the alcohol is integrated fairly well. On the other hand I really like the predecessor for its more pronounced bright, yet cooked, fruitiness in the foreground while there's enough cask influence to bolster up the finish, especially compared to Livet's normal 12 yo.Since the Illicit Still imho needed weeks if not months of contact with air to fully round out and blossom, the rating for the Licensed it meant to be a bit 'reserved for now' with 86 p. At this point I can acknowledge the differences and a supposed progression (despite the same age) from the Illicit Still, but I do not find this one better per se, just a tad different. All in all both are very good advanced beginners' malts @ sub 40 EUR and much preferrable over the usual - now different kinds of - 12 yo Livets @40/43% abv. in terms of richness, oily mouthfeel and prolonged finish. Highly recommended though beginners might find these a bit too demanding at first. :-)"
3390,Glenlivet 12-year-old  The Original Stories - Licensed Dram,"Apple & pear pie meets IPA hop flavours.Astonishingly, it is still whisky though :)And a good one.

3394,Glenlivet 12-year-old  The Original Stories - Licensed Dram,"After a surprisingly pleasant ‘12yo illicit still’ we now have this ‘12yo licensed dram’. The illicit gave me so much joy I instantly ordered 4 more bottles after emptying the first one. I’ve been busy with my first bottle for several weeks now. Fresh after popping the cork, and after several months of oxidation. At first I wasn’t very impressed. After a few weeks of oxidation not much changed. Now, after a month or 1.5 it’s time to make up the final ‘score’.Fudge, apples and hazelnuts. Cake dough. A little closed and definitely more bourbon driven then the illicit still. Some kind of a metal off note in like lead. Don’t like that and it seems this has gotten into due to oxidation. Caramelized apples, marzipan and some chalky notes. With water the nose falls apart quite a lot. Leaving it to be an everyone’s friend at the bottom of the market.Smooth upon arrival. But shortly after it starts to go in all kinds of directions. I get quite some dry flavors and the alcohol is too prominent in my opinion. After a while it starts to get more eased down. Orchard fruits, citrus fruits and honey. Not a lot of nuttiness inhere and again that lead-like note. Adding water gives the body a rather poor and watery impression.Medium. Fudge, caramel, butter, wood shavings, almond, nutmeg and licorice. Again lots of bourbon-like flavors. Adding water will shift the balance even more to bourbon. I really don’t get any sherried flavors. Quite some dry oaky sawdust at the end.It wouldn’t be wondered if the balance was 80% bourbon and 20% sherry. If the sherry cask part was bigger, the casks were at least not very active.. water doesn’t do any good, but without it, the alcohol annoys me a lot.In my opinion this is completely inferior to the illicit still. The illicit still ready added interesting twists to an otherwise rather boring 12yo Livet, giving more richness and sherry flavors to the whole. It gave an otherwise boring 12yo balls and character. This Licensed dram isn’t really adding any value for me. The higher ABV is more annoying then it gives me a smile. Adding water and this dram will fall apart instantly, returning to a boring 12yo again. So no.. this is not giving me goosebumps and it’s definitely a step down compared to Illicit. Leave it and spend your money otherwise is my advice ;)"

3428,Glenlivet 18-year-old  Batch Reserve,"Quick hit review.Pernod Ricard adjusted the ABV of Glenlivet 18 by 3%, but unfortunately into the wrong direction. Almost like a quality blend, the nose is characterized by apple sauce, cinnamon and sweet oranges. Very gentle and civilized on the palate as well, emphasizing fruity and spicy notes with a hint of dry oak. More on the short side, the finish is marked by nutmeg, grapefruit zest and soda.

3430,Glenlivet 18-year-old  Batch Reserve,"60 € for an 18 year old? You have to get it that way first. Some ten-year-olds cost more. Very mild and almost a blend, but pleasing to the crowd. Certainly not bad. For the money there are better things, but a lot more bad things. Quite interesting and also something for those who want to go in the direction of a distillery character. An all day dram for autumn. Would more percent have done him good? Perhaps. But I think he should be like that with 40%.Fermented grapes. One is reminded of the grape harvest. A whisky for a golden autumn? The color and the nose are definitely right. But overall rather flat. A little caramel, a little cinnamon, but the grapes dominate. Some fermented fruit in the form of apples and pears. The typical smell when you first come to a distillery. Exactly the same smell. The apples are clearer and more like sour apple rings from Trolli. Not very complex and no real depth either. But the aromas that are there are clear and remind you of whisky and the distillation of it. I like it.Vanilla and caramel as well as wood are evident. The sour apple rings go back a little. A sweet one remains. The nose is confirmed, but without the grapes. Light and mild, very little spice and even less depth. Almost in the direction of blend. The slightly fermented fruits remain.Also here rather mild and short, whereby the sweetness disappears a bit and it becomes drier, which I don't really like. Also wood and a little bit of raisins."

All in all very pleasant and very well done.  BUT: I personally like the Glenlivet 18 years much better. As is often the case, most whiskys reach their individual climax under the age of 20. In addition, only outstanding barrels stand out. It seems to be the same at Glenlivet. At the end there is a deduction for the miserable price-performance ratio. Dear people, this part is just absurdly overpriced."

3487,Glenmorangie 19-year-old  Finest Reserve,"[September, 2018] If you ever go to Scotland from Europe using the DFDS ferries (what I can recommend, because you can take your own car with you) - do not forget to check the special offers in their duty free shop. They stock a broad variety of fine single malts at very affordable price levels and the special offers (usually buy bottles instead of one) are real bargains these days. This Glenmorangie is a good example: one bottle for 95 Euro or two bottles for 75 Euro each. I could not resist…...and that was well done! This is a fine and flawless Glenmorangie that shows the best about its signature profile: A superb and balanced bourbon-cask matured spirit that is both elegant and quaffable. Certainly not suited for all thrill-seekers but a perfect dram to enjoy on a warm Indian summer evening in the Scottish highlands. By the way, I think 75 Euro is a fair price for a bottle of such a quality these days (but 120 Euro are way too expensive, according to my taste buds)...The colour is old gold and the nose offers this delicate signature Glenmorangie profile of honeys, sugars, yellow fruits and spices in a balanced mix. Nothing spectacular about it - just they way you wish a Glenmorangie to be with all the aromas you want to sniff in a relaxed highland setting on a warm summer night...The taste is fruity and barley sugary sweet with hints of white chocolate, vanilla, peppers and other spices and some strong but not too bold tannins from the wood. The balance is just about right for my taste buds but the wood should not grow stronger (I know that many modern connoisseurs prefer rather strong woods - but I prefer to drink whisky over chewing oak). Some water releases more aromas in the nose and flavours on the palate and it does a great job to contain the sometimes borderline bitter tannins to an enjoyable level. I like this dram best when reduced to about 35% abv (really!)...The initial mouthfeel is warming and nicely coating with a minor bitter-drying feeling from the tannins - depending on whether you are stressed or not it might be a little distracting or just about okay (guess what I am after a fine day in the highlands…). The finish is of medium length and adds more spices (chili, ginger) and more white chocolates to the party with a minor drying finish (yes, it is the oak again)."

What you had in your nose continues seamlessly in your mouth. It begins with a clear, caramel-like, sweet note of vanilla, which is actively supported by the light fruits. Somewhat tingling spice like ginger and red pepper from the barrels as well as hints of milk chocolate are noticeable towards the end, towards the finish. But it is more of a pleasant counterpoint to the previous fruit sweetness and thus ensures a taste balance.Towards the finish, the spicy and slightly bitter taste components become stronger. The milk chocolate from the mouth gets a little more cocoa content and turns into dark chocolate or even a small espresso with a hint of cream (in Vienna this is called a Einspänner when the cream, the whipped cream, is stiff). The vanilla, like the fruit, is still present. The finish is medium long."
3495,Glenmorangie 19-year-old  Finest Reserve,"Hmm, why this bottling. It looks a bit fresher and fruity like the 18, less sweet. Similar rail. Also good unspectacular dram."

Here is one of the rather rare whiskys that manage to increase the taste compared to the smell. The finish is nice, very pleasant, but a bit one-sided. I like it in the mouth very much.

3508,Glenmorangie Nectar D'Òr  4th Edition,"Very close to the signature Glenmorangie style, but I find it doesn’t really grab me. The sauternes cask finish doesn’t, in my opinion, bring out enough extra aspects to this whisky, or helps it develop some stand-out character and development. It’s a very nice, easy going whisky, but perhaps a bit too straightforward to be truly engaging. If you’ve got a sweet tooth, you’ll probably love this. And if you were ever trying to lure someone into liking whisky, this would do the trick. But truth be told, the original 10 yo would very likely get the job done as well, and that one is considerably cheaper.It has this soft buttery note which over time develops into a vanilla – custard note. There’s white fruit (melon, apricot) and some soft green tropical notes like kiwi as well. Something gently cereal, making for a vanilla cookie note. Definitely wine notes too, although not necessarily sweet, this comes across more like a medium dry white wine, but without any astringency. It does become noticeably more sweet over time as well as spicy and very softly musky as some nutmeg shows up (from the sémillon and sauvignon blanc, perhaps?). Overall quite nice, but perhaps a bit ‘simple’ and ‘easy’ as the dessert wine mostly ads sweetness to what is already soft and sweet to begin with? Let’s see what a drop of water does to this… It does accentuate some white fruit notes, but also brings an almost granulated sugary sweetness to it.the spices are more obvious and upfront, although this still remains soft, with sweet cereal and vanilla as the obvious notes, with a light-medium mouthfeel. I didn’t really pick up a million different flavours from this on the palate, but after some water there’s clear notes of white fruit and grapes, and it does bring out a more dry mouthfeel.The finish mostly echoes what the palate brings and it’s not overly long with a spice note (nutmeg again) that lingers about a bit."

It got better, different and more complex with every sip. A top Glenmorangie. A pleasure especially for port aficionados  With 20 gtt water it became sweet-fruity, but less complex and spicy - also very tasty, but more interesting for me without water.  Once tasted after a Graham Tawny Port 10yo. In a direct comparison with a really good port, you can clearly see how much of the very successful port barrel finishing is in this material"

3527,Glenmorangie Signet,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deThe first impression is characterized by chocolate-spicy and sweet-fruity notes. A wave of chocolate, fresh peaches, apricots, oranges, hints of grapefruit, vanilla pods, red grapes, pleasant sherry aromas (dark fruits), toasty aromas, abundant spices (cinnamon & ginger) and oak wood stands out powerfully from my glass. The alcohol (46%) is very well integrated. A little patience pays off when nosing: The multi-faceted and harmonious nose reveals many more nuances even after 20 to 30 minutes. The elegant complexity is just fun.The texture of the Glenmorangie Signet is wonderfully velvety soft and creamy. At the first sip, a slight tingle (ginger) on the tip of the tongue is noticeable. The start is very full-bodied and sweet and spicy. Plenty of oranges, grapefruit, vanilla pods, hints of tropical fruits and sherry notes (wild berries, raisins) dominate with intense spices (cinnamon and ginger) and toasty aromas (coffee / espresso). Milk chocolate, hints of leather, a touch of malt, dark forest honey and mature oak notes complete the aromatic variety. The well-selected alcohol content blends seamlessly into the harmonious overall picture.Medium to long, sweet and spicy and chocolaty. Dark forest honey, vanilla, oranges, grapefruits and light sherry notes flash again. Plenty of chocolate with a touch of mint (reminds me a little of After Eight), ginger, roasted aromas, nuts and oak make the Glenmorangie slowly fade away. On the palate remains a subtle bitterness."
3528,Glenmorangie Signet,"What a wonderful whisky. With lots of coffee and chocolate notes, it will seduce you into a silky-smooth taste sensation in a class of its own. I had been looking forward to it for a long time and finally André tested it for me as a video on YouTube. Conclusion: He was absolutely thrilled. Thanks again for the effort.All the notes of coffee, caramel, honey and spices dance on the nose. A kind of chocolate mint comes through and tempts you to take a quick first sip. A sherry cherry dessert on a leather plate. Very cool. Forest honey flavored with grated orange peel. Christmas is today! Great nose. Respect.When you arrive in the mouth, you are overwhelmed at first. Everything at once but very subtly interwoven. It takes more than 100ml to take it apart properly. Wow. I save the nouns for sherry notes on the chocolate coffee page. But I have to address this texture. Firm in the leather saddle with enough wood flavor on the whole palate and a rich, warm, silky-soft mouthfeel with aha effect. Very special. Respect to the master. Upper class whisky craft. Now I've forgiven the PLV too. The marginal price is forgotten. A great malt. Direct hit !!It stays medium to long on the palate with wonderfully spicy and typical nouns that appear on the whisky-chocolate side. This malt is a special experience and it made it onto our shelf straight away. House whisky. A big thank you goes to André for the big sample."
3529,Glenmorangie Signet,"The aroma is a sea of milk chocolate and black pepper in tandem with gingerbread cookies. The taste reflects the nose by adding caramel and grapefruit zest. The finish is long, rather spicy, chocolate-nutty. A very harmonious and rich whisky, the profile of the distillery is a little lost behind the awesome casks, but the nuances of the distillery slip. RATING: 90pts - | 90 - 92 (A-) → Excellent | - Here the golden pantheon begins."
3530,Glenmorangie Signet,"I didn't think that I would find too much wood, but in today's form, that's just too much wood and too little whisky for me.spicy, sweet, fruity, light and ripe, plus a nice note of wood, spices, a bit sour, nutty, quite dry sherry, plus something like olives. Actually cute, but headstrong. Not wrong.the mouth screams oak, almost too much, you have really burned logs in your mouth, at least that's how I imagine it. The sherry is dry and in the background, the bitter, spicy oak notes are in charge and almost too much.dry, only subtle fruit, a lot of wood, a lot of wood. Oak above everything. Spices and oak dominate the dry, tart finish."
3531,Glenmorangie Signet,"A very rich and syrupy desert dram. Full of coffee, chocolate fruit and cookies. The flavors are complex enough but still very approachable. The big winner her for me is the flavor as this is one of the best tasting scotches that I have ever had."
3532,Glenmorangie Signet,"This is most definitely one of the better Glenmorangies I've tasted.Full flavored and, in Glenmorangie terms of speaking, an intense nose. Peaches immediately. Also chocolate and a sweet corn-like flavor. Virgin oak and sherry oak both to be detected. Good balance. Not sensational though.Creamy milk chocolate like in those candy bars from ‘Kinder’. Red fruits, old furniture, and white pepper. Decent body. Gentle and balanced.Long. Sweet& sour finish. Polished oak, red fruits, sweet corn and vanilla. there is really a good balance between the different types of casks. Both did their part, both have their part."
3533,Glenmorangie Signet,"This whisky can best be described as sweet, very sweet coffee, without milk, with mixed cocoa powder (without bitterness) and orange liqueur. Great, just great! If you only put a drop of the malt on your tongue, it is like having liquid, sweet, dark chocolate in your mouth.  In the tasting again sweet coffee, ginger sticks coated with sweet chocolate (without ginger spiciness), sweet orange liqueur and many, many spices up to the cinnamon.  This malt is a masterpiece that the others in the distillery can't hold a candle to, and they probably shouldn't either, the composition is too unusual and independent for that!"

3538,Glenmorangie X,X By Glenmorangie is made for mixing. It was designed with top bartenders from all over the world and specifically created as a single malt for mixers and cocktails matured in bourbon barrels & smoked American oak casks. It’s said to have a richer and sweeter taste and it’s bottled at a low 40% ABV.
3539,Glenmorangie X,Unfortunately a very simple whisky that has little to offer besides orange notes and sweetness. Glenmorangie can definitely do better than that.

3548,Glenrothes 10-year-old  The Soleo Collection,"What I've had of Glenrothes have been what I find a little rough. This is rounder, despite a fairly spicy finish.Uncomplicated and easy drinkable.Thanks to karloff for the sample.Caramel and butterscotch.Something that at first seems a bit off, is it the butter?Karloff said sour milk, to me it's more like prune yoghurt, maybe not much difference?I suspect it is the slightly sulphorous wood.In it self an interesting nose, but I don't find it expressively appealing.Arrives surprisingly thick, almost waxy, for a 40%.Also surprisingly sweet compaired to the rather sour nose.A bit one dimentional classic caramel with a twist of citrus zest. To me the spice is not noticable until into the finish.A burst of spice in a rather short finish."
3549,Glenrothes 10-year-old  The Soleo Collection,"A very nice malt, not overpowering, but sending enough flavours where your enjoyment of the experience is clear.Ive avoided this Malt for a long time. Unfortunately it shares a name with a Fife town, sorry about that.

3550,Glenrothes 10-year-old  The Soleo Collection,"It has quite a few of the signature Glenrothes elements, and the youthfulness brings a pleasant ‘freshness’ to it, but it really lacks a bit of depth to really win me over. Obviously this is an entry level expression from a rather big brand, so it’s meant to be playing it on the safe side, but I can’t help but feel that at 43% ABV this would be significantly better.a clear buttery note (I often find this in Glenrothes) leading into caramelized butter and toffee, toffee apple, honeysuckle and biscuit (shortbread) notes. Hints of citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and something creamy - custard-y with a floral touch as well. I’m really enjoying this. Not complex by any means, but well balanced and inviting.soft arrival, dominated by the citrus notes with a creamy mouthfeel. The fruit is less ‘fresh’ with almost dried pears and apples, perhaps due to a woody, pencil shaving note that comes with it and at the back a warming touch of kitchen spices (nutmeg mostly, and faint hints of allspice). Still all very enjoyable, but perhaps a bit less impressive compared to the nose.a bit short-lived, unfortunately. It more or less has the palate fading out rather quickly, with wood and spices, a bit of an almost ashy dryness and an clay-like earthy note."
3551,Glenrothes 10-year-old  The Soleo Collection,"cereal, caramel, vanilla, lemon which denotes a little and spices, then the woodiness appears, undifferentiated cooked fruits, still cereal, fresh bitter almonds the finish is simple, a simple starter whisky, but more like a blend in my opinion!"
3552,Glenrothes 10-year-old  The Soleo Collection,"I haven't had a lot of Glenrothes but what I do know is that this is nowhere near as good as the Select Reserve I had many years ago.The first thing that hits you is the caramel, lots of caramel. Something I have never found in a whisky before and thats sour milk, or should I say milk that is just on the turn. Dates, raisins and prunes. Stewed vegetables, cinnamon and just a hint of sulphur. You would think all of this combined would be unpleasant, but it's not, it's actually ok.The caramel is also quite dominant on the taste but for 40% it has a lot more bite than others I have tasted. When I am working on my allotment I often pick some lemon balm leaves to chew on and it is definitely present here. Then there are the spices, too much for me and I think it dulls it considerably.A short to medium finish. Those spices do quiet down and then fade. There is just a hint of liquorice on the death."
3553,Glenrothes 10-year-old  The Soleo Collection,"Soft, extremely strong, light as a cloud dessert and confectionery malt. There is no difficulty in it, a good option for every day.A ton of baking generously showered with vanilla, caramel, apple charlotte sprinkled with honey, orange zest, whipped cream, cookies.Sweetish with a light delicate citrus sourness, a little majestic notes. Honey muffins, vanilla pudding, cookies.A little malleable, warming, slightly tart. Suddenly coffee and chocolate, tobacco, fruit tea, and a light nutiness appear."

Taste is light, soft, a little underpowered. Not lacklustre as such - it has just about enough at the abv not to be too flat and watery ... but it's very borderline. Slightest struck match. Faintly buttery. Increasingly peppery. Watery milk with white pepper. Slight oaky bitterness. No heat at all. Any sherry character is subtle. Maybe some lingering charred wood.This is fairly disappointing. It's fine, I suppose, but Glenrothes makes some good whisky and I'm not sure they're doing themselves a great service with putting this out as their flagship whisky.

The next one in the series is their 40 Year Old which will set you back some 3.000 EUR, so count your blessings. This 25 years old malt matured on sherry casks – hence Soleo, because that hints at the sun of Andalusia, where the casks are sourced.Ooh, that’s a delicious nose. Tropical fruit like oranges and quite a bit of pineapple, overripe bananas and blueberries. This is followed by freshly squeezed orange juice, plums and sniffing tobacco. Rose petal, cassis and a handful of nuts. If you give it your time (which I did), you’ll even discover some salted caramel, rose water and the juice of a pomelo. Very good!Good body. The sweet fruit is immediately supported by a lovely spiciness with cloves and nutmeg in the lead, followed by liquorice, vanilla and cardamom. This is quite nice. Evolves towards leather with a pinch of salt and chewing tobacco in the mix. Mildly drying towards the end.Good finish as well. While not very long, there is a lot going on. Leather, tobacco, plum marmalade, woodsmoke, sunflower oil and the juice of blood oranges.Compex and impressive Glenrothes if you take your time with it.

Wauw.A nose like a time-machine, transporting us back to the old days with long aromas of plum-tabac, prumes, overripe bananas and wet earth.The 25 years gives us a very balanced palet that enters the mouth beautifully. It's not aggressive but it hits you. A clever combination of white clay, sunflower oil, specs of salt, strong spices, a lot of different sweets and at the end some unmistakably tones of leather. Beautiful drink!A lot of things happening in this superb long finish. Hint of spices, some dust and leather, tabac seems to come back, eery fumes, even something rotton (covered with sweets).

3596,Glenrothes Whisky Maker's Cut  The Soleo Collection,"[November, 2019] Ooops, I did it again and bought a bottle of sherried whisky without trying it before but because Jim scored it 95 points (and he is very sensitive to sulphur) chances are good this is clean stuff......and it is. This alone is a great achievement in itself (for Glenrothes that often released sulphur-spoiled casks in the past) and I guess sherry whisky lovers will like this very much. It is good to get an impression how paxarette-improved drams tasted in the past (for reasonable bucks) despite I doubt they used paxarette on these casks. To me this dram is a little too simplistic and designed (or in other words: too immature), but this is just my personal taste...The colour is chestnutoloroso sherry and the nose offers a clean sherry profile that reminds me a little of old paxarette-improved drams. This is dry oloroso at its best with all its sweet fruity and sour winey aromas in an appropriate wooden setting. It is pretty fine but a little simple, to be honest. The malt adds almost nothing to the nose, too bad. After significant breathing time the wood grows stronger while the sherry retreats somewhat, I like the initial nose better.The taste is flawless and of a delicious oloroso sherry profile with some barley sugary impressions, at least. The wood is stronger than in the nose but there are mostly spices and less tannins, hence it is enjoyable this way. Again, this profile is rather simple but easy quaffable if you like full-throttle-sherried drams.The dram arrives a little hot on the palate with a warming and peppery mouthfeel and a minor coating effect, only. The finish is rather short and adds some milk chocolatey impressions that are tasty. No bitter-drying moments here what indicates rather short maturation times (hence NAS). Water strenghtens the sherry aromas again both in the nose and on the palate - I like this dram best when reduced to about 43% abv."
3597,Glenrothes Whisky Maker's Cut  The Soleo Collection,"Olé!Exactly two years ago, in September 2018, Glenrothes announced that they were abandoning the so-called Vintages. In it’s stead they put out the Soleo Collection with age statement. They now have a 10, 12, 18, 25 and even 40 Year Old. The only exception is this Whisky Maker’s Cut, that is bottled at a slightly higher ABV and matured on sherry casks from Andalusia.The nose is very clean and creamy with hints of hazelnut, caramel and blood oranges. Very soft notes of nutmeg and some fresh tea leaves. The wood slowly becomes louder. Far from bad, but nothing spectacular either.Oh! I spoke too soon! On the palate, this is a nice flavor bomb. Honeysweet on oloroso and vanilla with a good spiciness. Sweet malt and lots of fruit like raisins, plums and oranges caress the tongue. It’s not the most complex Glenrothes, but it is certainly a very pleasant and quaffable sherry matured malt with some punch.In the long, spicy and warm finish it suddently turns quite creamy, making me daydream of a summer holdiday.

Alcohol barely noticeable.In the mouth, unfortunately, a disappointment. Short sherry fruitiness and incredibly hot. Alcohol not well integrated. With a little water, it remains uncomfortably sharp. The sharpness only gets down if you add significantly more water. From around 40% vol. It is then ok. Aromas then also evaporate in the mouth and it quickly becomes watery.The finish is short with light sherry flavors. Otherwise he is pale. Hardly noticeable of the aromas with water."

It was the 17YO that I liked at the time - which excludes participation from this, since the 17YO contains whisky that is at least 17 years old.  This is a look at it. Disaster. Delightful, of course. Soft, mild, smooth, smooth is the word. I picture myself with a tumbler with ice and this scotch being a little bit James Bond - were it not for drinking that vodka martini and never leaving ice nor tumblers near my whisky. Vanilla ice cream, with an egg smooth soft finish, not too long, but very good. Slobber whisky is an insult to such a cultured Scotch - yes, capitalized indeed - but I can imagine you just make a bottle of a soldier one night without noticing it.

3616,Glentauchers 15-year-old  Special Distillery Bottling - Allied,"[April, 2014]  I had a dram at the bar of the Craigellachie hotel.  This is one bottling out of six for a special millennium edition intended for sale to Allied employees only but as it was rather weakish a lot of bottles found their way into specialist retail shops for quite a lot of money back then (150 Deutschmark = 77 Euro in mid 2000). In my old rating system (ten scales that translate into WB points: 50 - 66 - 75 - 80 - 82,5 - 85 - 87,5 - 90 - 92,5 - 95) I scored it 82,5.  My notes state a nice bourbon cask profile with only a few flaws.  This is the best bottling out of this edition, but nevertheless not really good.  But why bottled Allied such flawed stuff for their employees?"

So it loses some points here for me. It's still nice though and if you like your sherry bomb then you probably would love this.A real sherry influence here, as expected. Dried fruits, like raisins and dried figs. A leather note and dark chocolate. Then it starts to become fruitier, with mainly dark forest fruits such as blueberries, sweet blackberries and dark cherries. Some honey here as well. Followed by caramel fudge and a hint of toffee. After a while, it also gets a hint of red berries. Nice, but not much of the Glentauchers character so far. With water: somewhat less heavy. It becomes fruitier and it adds some freshness from oranges and a hint of lemons. Strawberries too.Sweet forest fruits at first, blueberries and sweet ripe blackberries again. This is followed by leather. A sweet note from honey. And spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper and chilli peppers. I think we need some water here.... Sooo, with water: That's better.

Aroma is spiced apple pie, charred wood, a touch of those thin dried seaweed sheets, peppery ... maybe some muddy wellies … but it's mostly all those other things I said before I lost the plot. Gets papery later on. Taste is very soft at 50%. I'm sure it would drink like water if it were diluted to 40% - they did the right thing bottling it stronger. It has a watery impact with some peppery flavours, leading to charred wood on the linger. This is perhaps the softest and easiest 50% whisky I can remember drinking. It's actually quite hard to discern flavours from it - other that those that come from the peat that is. Yes, some oily peat, some fumey smoke, char and burnt food bits scraped from a bbq. Quite a straight-forward sort of peat sitting on that easy watery spirit. No obvious cask character and no obvious base spirit character either. Just clean and easy peat smoke delivery. A good whisky without a doubt, with an almost unrivalled level of softness at the ABV, although not massively stand-out otherwise. 3.5/84"
3627,Glenturret 10-year-old - Peat Smoked  2020 Maiden Release,"This. Is. Good. If you’re a regular reader of my blog, you know I’m a peat head. But well, as I’ve already said, peat is God’s way to tell us “I love you”! This is good, this is fresh, this is complex with lots of layers and flavours to pick, a longer and calmer sitting with this would make me probably write twice longer notes, but for once I don’t want to publish this blog post too long after the tasting. Anyway. It’s cheap, while the Triple Wood might have been a bit expensive for what it offered, the five additional pounds here make you jump to another level. Definitely worth the price.No doubt, peat was involved! Wood smoke, citrusy and fresh, this starts really well. Slightly salty, it also delivers vanilla and honey on the nose, Band-Aid plasters, and the feeling of walking inside a forest by the sea. It also makes me think of gin, maybe a juniper note? Reduction didn’t change much the nose, maybe a tad sweeter.Surprisingly light arrival for a 50% abv, the alcohol doesn’t bite you at all. Soot, heavily charred oak, with a lasting sourness of roasted lemons, coffee grounds, grapefruit juice and ginger. The alcohol is very well integrated, it absolutely doesn’t require water. After a while, chocolate and ash appear. Water makes it slightly more peppery.Medium long on lemon, bitter orange, oak char, with a lasting warmth in the throat."
3628,Glenturret 10-year-old - Peat Smoked  2020 Maiden Release,"For me, a combination of distillery character and peat that is not the right one for me.

3633,Glenturret 10-year-old - Peat Smoked  2020 Maiden Release,"Quite a nice and tasty smoky malt that hardly does anything wrong, but also cannot offer too much. Most of it is made by the aromatic smoke in connection with the strong but never intrusive honey / fruit sweetness.In the first moment, smoke arrives. A bit resinous, but otherwise quite harmonious and round smoke. Hardly anything of the alcohol can be felt. A nice sweetness is followed by light fruit notes like red apple and vineyard peach. Somehow the furry of the peaches is there too. Now some alcohol comes through too. All in all very ""fat"", ""dense"" and tasty but not too much to get out ofHeavy smoke is followed by a strong kick. Not overly alcoholic but with a lot of thump. The sweet but also the slightly furry one lays on the tongue. The fruits come to the fore. Honey and a saltiness comes through. Again tasty but unfortunately not particularly complexThe finish is relatively long. But that's because of the 50% and the smoke. The rest is done by the always present, light sweet. The weakest link in the chain"

3636,Glenturret 12-year-old  2020 Maiden Release,"Almost completely wood-driven, and extremely herbal/tart, but very charismatic.Say what you want, but this really is a different take on a twelve-year-old entry-level bottling. Very woody, to be sure, but also... interesting. As was to be expected, the tart, spicy and dark aromas predominate. I find branches and twigs, resin and tree sap, a sense of autumn leaves and damp forest floor, as well as essential oils of pine, fir and eukalyptus. No idea what was in those European oak casks before they filled them with spirit, but since there is not too much fruitiness, it doesn't seem like they were all ex-sherry casks (perhaps some virgin oak or wine barriques in the mix?). With time – once the brain begins to fade out the onslaught of oak – some dried fruit and nutty aromas emerge, as well as licorice root and bitter, overstewed black tea. Too tart and oak-heavy for my taste, but, you can't deny that they went against the (wood) grain with this one, and as a result produced a truly different 12-year-old that shows a lot of depth and character (though, it has to be said, very little distillery character).There is some savory, slightly salty sweetness from the get-go, so here the ex-sherry casks do make their presence felt. I like that the oak, while super-present, is not ""spiky"", harsh or peppery, which could've easily happened, I guess. It's actually very mild for 46 percent, and the mouthfeel can well be described as silky, buttery, perhaps even oily. Tastewise there's cashew, caramel, raisin, honey, as well as all of the herbal and arboreal aromas that the nose already announced. Still way too tart, spicy, herbal and woody, but I'm impressed by the texture.Very herbal, showing eukalyptus, camphor, rosemary, but also nicely oily and resiny, with some welcome berry-fruit sweetness, a good texture and staying power."
3637,Glenturret 12-year-old  2020 Maiden Release,"Several online sources raved about this bottling, which made me very curious. However for me an overly large dose of European oak and a background floral-varnish aroma dampen the experience. A decent sherried whisky."

3640,Glenturret 12-year-old  2020 Maiden Release,"The “wood bill” added to the new make some depth and some typical and rich sherry notes. Nose and palate here tend to make this a Christmas dram, though honestly, don’t try to make me believe you wouldn’t drink that every other day of the year. It might have been a bit better with a slightly higher abv, though. Blind I would have said here it was bottled at 43% abv.That’s European oak for you! Sherry notes of fig and dark fruits appear, but there’s also a slight citrusy side to it. Vanilla extract and caramel make you think American white oak was involved too. This is also slightly estery. Spices, cola flavoured sweets and dunnage warehouse.Sweet and spicy arrival, slightly oily. Whisky flavoured bitter orange marmalade, milk chocolate, charred oak, with some ginger, nutmeg and pepper.

Expansion: Bourbon barrels (refilled) and sherry barrels (first filled) Nose: Fruity and powerful in the beginning, quite a few different jams. Blackberries, dried strawberries and caramelized apples. The fruit flavors are thick, sweet and syrupy. With butter biscuits and cinnamon, a little ginger. I also find old paper, a little leather, nougat and cherries. Palate: Strawberry jam meets black currants and lots of wood. Walnuts with honey, colored pepper and cinnamon. The oak strikes quite a bit, which is good for the whisky. My thoughts keep going back to the strawberry jam that has a lot to offer. Finish: Long to very long, reflects the palate very well. The wood aromas become significantly more bitter towards the end, the whisky drier. The sweet fruit aromas disappear, leaving oak wood and various spices. Conclusion: From my point of view, the sherry flavors dominate, overall a strong Glenturret with a lot of sweetness and spices. Impressively. 87/100 points (2021). www.notesofmalt.com"

3657,Glenturret Triple Wood  2020 Maiden Release,"This entry level NAS hides its probable youth with a lot of wood and a slightly too low abv. While there are still smells and flavours to find, the nose stays a bit shy and the palate a bit thin due to the lack of a few percent abv.The nose is a bit shy at first. Faint wood notes, with a sweet toffee aroma, apricot dipped in caramel, custard-filled cake, then allspice before getting a fruit explosion of orange and pineapple.The arrival is a bit thin, unfortunately, due to the low abv (at least it’s not 40%!) with bitter notes of lemon tea and quite a lot of wood. There’s also some spiciness with a bit of ginger and cinnamon, and a pinch of black pepper. Afterwards, it becomes floral (thinking nasturtium petals), with hints of liquorice, menthol and aniseed.Quite long, sweet and fresh, fruity, with the wood still here but in the background."
3658,Glenturret Triple Wood  2020 Maiden Release,"At first, the nose filtered out as a real surprise effect, but the taste unfortunately flattens the experience a bit.

All good.Spices, slightly peppery notes, chilli chocolate, sweet and sour apples, fruit jelly from cheap Jaffa cakes, a little pink Turkish delight, delicate spicy notes of sherry. Accompanied by a pleasant lime acidity, sweetish dark spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg and a little dark caramel. Quite a complex story to be honest. It's fun to dig your way through the flavors.Again spices and a slight nuttiness, plus some spicy dark wood and very delicate chocolate. Maybe a touch, really just a touch of furniture polish, which is more likely to be overwhelmed by simple ""cheap"" (glazed) wood. Significantly more one-sided here than in the nose, makes for a bit of disappointment. But it is certainly ok.Nice chocolate notes with some coffee and roasted nuts.

A little spiciness lingers on for a short while.  Then some bitter notes that are neither pleasant nor unpleasant.All in all a rather acceptable entry malt, but nothing you will remember for long.

3671,Highland Park 10-year-old  Viking Scars,"I went through a few bottles of this six years ago from the old livery and found them a decent budget option. Nose - light peat and honey, but all very light with little jumping out at me. On the palette, you get those trademark HP notes of heather, honey and light peat. It’s all very clear and straight as an arrow, with minimal sherry influence. The finish has some surprising heft of dry smoke and sweet honey. I have to say I am enjoying this more than a recent bottle I had of HP12, which I found very discordant (perhaps a bad batch?) in its sherry/peat mix. It’s a shame this 10yo is only bottled at 40% abv, though it certainly punches above its weight a bit. For a budget single malt, you could do a lot worse than this. Frankly between this bottle and the rather enjoyable Magnus, Highland Park is doing a fine job of putting solid budget options on the market. Well done!"

3679,Highland Park 12-year-old  Viking Honour,"The last Highland Park bottle I purchased was Dragon Legend, which I liked so thought it was about time I tried the latest 12 year to see if it was worth buying a session bottle as it were?Well it is a big, fat no from me because this is rubbish, I can`t believe this is what the distillery passes off as the opener in their core range these days.I know it is only £25-£35, so many will say ""what do expect for that sort of money""?What I expect is something worth opening to be honest, this is just manufactured, sickly sweet, coloured and caramelised crap, it is awful. I must be honest but I was struggling to call this whisky, it tasted more like one of those dreadful 30% whisky liqueurs.Does Highland Park really think this sort of putrid offering is the sort of thing to lure in people new to whisky, if they do. well they need to re think their strategy because I would rather drink gin than this.The reason I am having a rant is because it was Highland Park 12 year that got me started on my whisky journey over 20 years ago, HP 12 back then meant something which was a quality, tasty dram at a reasonable price and something that could be relied upon for quality.Highland Park management, you should hang your collective heads in shame for trying to pass this vile oversweet, tasteless and soulless whisky off as a quality dram, you have gone the way of Macallan but. at least you are a bit cheaper for your base offering I suppose. This makes Laphroaig Select look like a quality dram and Laphroaig select is rubbish too.I got the Dragon Legend bottle when it first came out, I need to buy another one to see if they have reduced the quality in that one too.WTF Highland Park, just WTF are you doing?"

Delicate aroma of dried fruit, like juicy fruit in front of the nose. In the mouth, orange juice, dried fruit, caramel, cantaloupe and more, followed by a honey-like Highland Park signature nectar smoke.

3690,Highland Park 16-year-old  Wings of the Eagle,"A Highland Park, clearly marked where it came from - which was not the case with some of the more recent bottlings. The combination of light smoke and flower or heather scent is, in my opinion, what makes a typical Highland Park. And this whisky actually offers both.Smoke, yes! Not much, but noticeable, the warm, gentle smoke of a fire fueled with dry wood. Floating above, but stronger, against the smoke easily asserting flower scent - heather? From me ... With time (and a few drops of water), fruity aromas are added: apricot, strawberry and orange. The overall impression is mature, harmonious and complexMild wood notes, which, if at all, only taste of smoke, fragrant and spicy honey, apricot and strawberry, with dried dates. The addition of water does not result in any noticeable change. The overall impression is tasty and stately, but not difficult or even intrusive, but of mature, almost elegant restraint.Fruitiness and spice give a very short guest performance, smoky and woody aromas linger a bit, but really only a little longer. A few percent more alcohol would have been helpful at least at this point. In this respect, the addition of water can not improve the overall impression."

Set in taste and the way to the 18 is not far anymore ... so how some people here talk / write badly ... I don't understand. It has a complex nose and that also shows up in the taste. In all honesty: this is one of the best HPs in recent years. I'm starting to doubt myself ... did I get another batch? They are all from 2018, so there shouldn't be such big differences (?).

A round malt that has everything you can expect from a 16 year old.medium to long finish of (oak) spice and fruit. Very, very late there is a leathery / ashy note (cold campfire)."
3692,Highland Park 16-year-old  Wings of the Eagle,"All in all pretty mannered dram. The alcohol is surprisingly strong enough, but it lacks in complexity, especially considering the 16 years. Since I had better, but admittedly much worse of Highland Park in the glass.Distinct smoke, surprisingly phenolic for HP, because the hospital is quaking! After a while, the smoke has dropped significantly. In addition, there are now floral notes, but I can not find any fruit or caramel or similar. With plenty of time and warmth, apricots and oranges are added, but very restrained. Damp forest floor.Mild in the beginning, slightly oily, honey sweet, the alcohol pushes backwards but quite clearly. In addition then a clearly spicy component, ginger. Fruit in turn, no indication.The finish is quite short, it warms slightly, then dries and is already gone."

Almost like whisky flavoured vodka or something an extraordinary disappointment.Surprising how far the once great Highland Park has fallen in the past ten years.I don't know who this marketed to and who is buying this regularly. I can't see the business model of producing expensive flavourless whisky will pay off for long.

3699,Highland Park 16-year-old - Twisted Tattoo,"RiojaTwisted Tattoo? Seriously? What’s that all about? Anyway, the interesting thing about this HP is the fact that it matured on a combination of bourbon casks and Rioja wine casks. La Rioja is a wine region in northern Spain that takes its name from the Rio Oja. Tempranillo is the most commonly used blue grape for their red wines. As far as I know, this is the first time HP uses this type of cask.Well, the bourbon casks have clearly put their foot down. I get the typical notes of grain cookies, coconut, citrus and apples. This is joined by heather – typical HP – and a touch of woodsmoke. Smoky? Nope. After a few minutes I do get some blackberries and some toffee apples. Quite underwhelming, actually.It is nicely creamy and sweet, but it surprises me with its flavor profile. The typical HP notes are somewhat subdued due to the blackberries and gooseberries, bitter oranges and something that reminds me of liquorice. The peat now does kick in and makes for a nice smokiness. Midpalate, it turns very dry, though.The finish is long and drying.Well, this is not my favorite Highland Park, I must say. Does little for me. Around 90 EUR, which can hardly be called cheap."
3700,Highland Park 16-year-old - Twisted Tattoo,"A very pleasant Highland Park with a surprising taste profile. It is reminiscent of the Highland Park 30 years, but can not keep up with the complexity and taste due to the age.  A very tasty whisky that deserves the title ""good"".You pour the TT into the Nosing-glass and the Boubon barrels are immediately to smell. With the nose on the glass you can notice heather, a fine peat note and a heavy berry scent. Black currants, orange peel and wine, with the bourbon notes always subliminally resonate. The alcohol is well dosed.On the tongue creamy, soft, peat, from one second to the next incredibly complex and within 10 - 20 seconds everything is gone.  On the second sip, the bourbon barrel comes with a strong hint of vanilla, the tingle on the tongue and then the weight of the wine.At the first sip hardly a departure to notice.  The second sip is different, long and a lot of wood with a delicate, dry bitterness."

3709,Highland Park 18-year-old  Viking Pride,"I've loved the HP 18yo since I've become a malthead and bought it as my 2nd or 3rd full bottle in a little shop in my village around 2002. I've always loved the intermingling of sherry, peat and really well integrated age that makes this dram so complex and sophisticated. The ""Viking Pride"" theme may be a bit of a weird marketing stunt that is absolutely unnecessary when you have a product of such high quality. I guess this marketing stuff makes this whisky surmount the 100 quid mark - which from a connoisseurs' pov is also unnecessary. In spite of that I'd still buy a bottle.Rich complex barley, wild honey, white nougat, burning heather, herbs (bay leaf, lavender and thyme) and a wonderful aroma of roasted coffee. Really quite a complex and beautiful composition, there are good casks involved. No water needed. This noses older than 18 years and unlike any other single malt.Cool and oily mouthfeel, getting richer, with a bit of bite just attacking the tongue after a few seconds. Very rounded, but never generic.It's a beautifully aged, dry and rich malt, with notes of stout ale, burnt raspberries infused with caramel, mint tea, something savoury like herbal butter spread on some nicely grilled beef, heather honey and soft, leathery, earthy peat whispering in the background and giving this whisky structure and complexity. You can really feel the beautiful marriage of good quality sherry and bourbon casks and showing off a textbook Highland Park distillery character.Long, on soft dry peat, sea salt and honey. Just very, very good."

Extremely supple without irritation, the sherry cask taste is very rich, full of dried raisins, caramel, freshly baked bread, orchid-like aromas. It is followed by an elegant smoky, again sweet smoked with honey. Compared with the past impression, the smoky smell seems to be less heavy.

Now I was lucky that André had done that shortly before Corona. So it was finally possible for me to devote enough time to the ""King of HP"" with enough large samples. From here, a big thank you to André.Who goes to the glass too quickly and not at least 30 minutes. can wait a bit disappointed. Only the standards are there immediately: oak, peat and the best notes of sherry. But then after a certain amount of time in the glass plus a few drops of water, the very large fruit basket spreads out. You will find everything your heart desires very interwoven and complex. It feels like the fruit cream tart from the pastry shop! Heijeijei, what a nose. If the palate and the finish survive this, this evening will last until late into the night.With a lot of power and volume, he does exactly what the nose promised. Impressive notes of sherry without getting obtrusively dirty. With a texture balance of sweet, salty, sour and pleasantly bitter, he lets his 25 year old muscles flex. At least now I have understood how the hefty price came about. But I wouldn't make it a unicorn, because for me it is the logical further development of the 18er. So you can explain it quickly. The big brother of the famous 18, but striking and much more complex. Butter biscuits spread with jam. Tender caramel and grapes in dark chocolate nuts round off the experience. Warm, tangy spiciness leads to the transition. WOW: That should never end!A delicate transition to the finish. The finest oak chips lie in a cigar box made of the finest leather and are covered with old tobacco leaves. Everything stays on the palate for a long time like hot dark chocolate and brings back memories of the fruit basket nose on all levels. Amazing! What this malt delivers is the very highest art, also in terms of barrel management. Here the best of everything has been given to the best people. Nothing is left to chance. A class 25, carefully planned down to the last detail. Arrived in whisky heaven. Thanks to HP, just great!"
3723,Highland Park 25-year-old,"It's hard to find words that do this Single Malt justice. For many connoisseurs, Highland Park 25 is the Holy Grail of the distillery's official bottlings, and rightly so. I could literally spend hours with my nose in the Glencairn. Dark fruits, white chocolate and juicy oranges take turns with spices, cocoa beans and rummy notes. An explosion of sweet, dry and peppery flavors coats the palate while being perfectly balanced and complex at the same time. Distant hints of smoke remain of a prolonged, sweet and spicy finish.

But I would have prefered it a little sweeter and less dry. No complaints about lenght, and there is a nice touch of fruit under a transperent blanket of light smoke at the very end."
3725,Highland Park 25-year-old,"Although it states ""new bottle design"" for 2012 it was in fact a new bottle design for the 2007 release https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/34416/highland-park-25-year-old that was bottled at 48.1% abv. The 2012 release was the first of many different batches at 45.7% abv. And that first release in 2012 at 45.7% abv doesn't mean that all HP 25yo of 45.7% abv are bottled in 2012. Unfortunately HP doesn't do anything to indicated the different batches that have come out over the last six years. The HP 25yo I believe was released annually from 2012-2018 and I would estimate that the 30yo HPs of the same abv 45.7% had 3-5 different batches over the years starting in 2012 -2018, as well I've personally seen difference in colour between two bottles of the same 45.7% abv. Although it's well known that almost every year there was new bottles hitting the market at higher prices points in accordance with each new batch release. There is no discernible markings or stamp dating to indicate batch differences like with the Glendronach core range releases.One really needs to have two different batches to compare the colour difference, if you see a HP 25yo and its more gold colour with very little hint of amber that's the one that I had and rated an 87 https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/79566 , the darker one is a shade or two darker and you would definitely notice it being amber in colour to a certain degree.

3726,Highland Park 25-year-old,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deImmediately after pouring, the 25-year-old Highland Park is already showing its full-bodied, intense and elegant side. A multifaceted conglomeration of many different flavors flows to me hesitantly. With the Nosing one can well and gladly spend an hour. Wavy changes the nose and gradually unfolds its full potential. Lots of dates, many juicy oranges, a few dried orange peel, caramel sweets, dark chocolate, cocoa for baking and intense honey notes form the first aromatic base. The sherynoten win in the course of nosing significantly in intensity. Over ripe apples, hints of red fruits, raisins, walnuts, roasted almonds and many different spices (eg nutmeg and ginger) mix with spicy oak notes. The background is always a delicate smoky note. The alcohol (45.7%) is perfectly integrated.The texture of the Highland Park is silky soft, almost syrupy, the malt wets the entire oral cavity. A few peppercorns prance on the tip of the tongue for a short time before the dark, spicy-sweet aromas fully unfold. Juicy oranges, hints of red fruit, raisins, dates, honey, caramel, sweet pipe tobacco, dark dark chocolate and a touch of espresso mingle with many different spices and stately oak notes. The fine smoky note blends in wonderfully with the harmonious overall picture. The taste is very harmonious and balanced, always intense, elegant and multi-faceted.Long, sweet and spicy and warm. Black cherries, baked apples, juicy oranges, dates, raisins and plenty of dark dark chocolate are present. A short time later, nutmeg, cinnamon, a touch of leather, sweet pipe tobacco and spicy, old Eichholznoten follow. The fine smoky note lingers pleasantly in the background again and ensures the final fine-tuning. A subtle dryness remains on the palate."

3729,Highland Park 25-year-old,"[February, 2021] Another different batch of the (usually) excellent 25-years old Highland Park, so far I enjoyed all of them......and this legacy does not change. This is very quaffable stuff, actually it is dangerously quaffable (dangerous both to your health and your wallet). What else to say? Slàinte!The colour is deep copper and the nose offers the excellent HP profile with its trademark heather honey aroma beside fruits, autumn florals, waxes, spices and shy peaty impressions. All is well balanced and without any off-note. The wood provides a sound but never dominating backing to the spirit-driven aromas, just the way it should be. It grows stronger upon breathing so take your time with this nose, and if available use a big spherical blender's glass which makes a huge difference to a Glencairn.The taste is complex and nicely layered which makes chewing a great joy. All the adorable aromas of the nose repeat themselves on the palate and they support each other greatly. The wood is a little stronger than it was with the nose but this is highly welcomed given the sweet fruity-honeyed-sugary profile. Old-style waxes, vegetable oils and bitter herbs ensure the balance and generate a very interesting tasting experience. Again, no flaw or imbalance that I can find.The initial mouthfeel is warming and instantly coats all parts with a creamy texture, pretty nice. The finish is long and adds more spices and traces of cocoa which I really like. No bitter-astringent moments until the very end, this was an excellent casks selection. Water releases more aromas in the nose and turns the taste even more quaffable but like so often the layers intermingle now. I like to explore this dram neat first and then add some drops for an enhanced drinking pleasure."

3735,Highland Park Dark Origins,"Big, brutal, black. This is a bit of a funny whisky from Highland Park. It lacks all the usual finesse that people over the years have associated with the distillery and in its place there’s this loud, brash, bombastic dirty sherry bomb, all wrapped in black and looking like a whisky only a goth could love.This is another one of those whiskies that really grabbed my attention the first time I poured a dram. I can remember it coming out and getting a lot of flack for how it looked, the fact it was a NAS release and that the price was considered to be over the top. It probably was a few quid over the odds but you could find it on offer if you looked and then it actually became something of a real bargain.Smell and taste wise ‘dirty’ is a good descriptor. On the nose, sherry, a certain oldness, old oak furniture and faint smoke, cocoa and dried fruits. Baking spices mingle with a very faint sulphur note. Some marmalade or Seville oranges. Coffee? Dates and figs. It’s quite punchy. The palate is sweet, sherried, spicy, there’s that typical Highland Park smoke note in there but it’s wrapped up in a sherry, cocoa, dark chocolate sauce, oak and over-cooked marmalade cake blanket. There’s a dirtiness to the flavours but not in a bad way. A funky richness (a tiny tinge of sulphur in a nice way, think the far away whiff of matchboxes) and a wee bit of coastal salinity. It’s here that the 46.8% ABV helps really hammer the palate home. It’s a really good delivery of flavours. The finish is big and ballsy, cocoa, wood, sherry and smoke with a pinch of campfire ash, long and drying but not unpleasant.Highland Park’s Dark Origins was a hugely divisive bottling when it came out. A relatively expensive whisky without an age statement, slightly over the top packaging and a dubious backstory. I still think the illustration of Magnus Eunson on the tube looks naff, but overall, it’s aged surprisingly well. I feels like more of a bargain now than when it was released. Well worth a punt if you can find it at a reasonable price."
3736,Highland Park Dark Origins,"10 rates 90 - 94. There must be something very wrong with me.Light smoke and some chocolate but with a completely different sherry influence TMHO. Not as light, pleasant and sweet. There's also that nuttiness in here but it hides away deeper down in musty dungeon. (Dark Origin ?)I'm not that impressed by the taste either. There are decent NAS whiskies but this is not one of them. Harsh, spicy, unbalanced and too much bitterness.

3738,Highland Park Dark Origins,
3739,Highland Park Dark Origins,"An intriguing version of Highland Park spirit. The taste has a wonderful pace, and each flavor profile is well integrated without dominating. It's matured using 80% first fill sherry casks, and the commitment to quality definitely shows. Cereal notes, floral, bitter cherries, and dry leaves.Sweet peat, sea spray, vanilla.Chocolate with peatFloral chocolate (orange blossom dark chocolate cordials) gives way to peated honey."
3740,Highland Park Dark Origins,"sweet sherry, honey, spices, fine smoke more toasted, caramel, sweetness in the mouth! the candied fruit slightly macerated in return."
3741,Highland Park Dark Origins,"Sherried NAS HP, not the most elegant or complex malt, but overall very decent, clean sherry, and the 46,8% are becoming."
3742,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"Typical HPHighland Park loves to profile itself with the slogan ‘best spirit in the world’, but many aficionados were somewhat disappointed with the distillery of late. The official releases are too many too fast and much too expensive. ‘Is it still about quality or is it all about quantity?’, I often hear. And still. From time to time a lovely HP is released at a normal price, like this Dragon Legend that costs less than 50 EUR. Let’s give it a chance, I say.It offers a very sweet nose on caramel and toffee, joined by apples, cherries, citrus and some dark plums. Somewhat waxy. Hint of white chocolate. Just a bit of Orkney peat offers some soft smoke and notes of heather. But all in all, this is a quite pleasant nose.The body is crap. Almost watery. Pity. But the taste is ok. It starts on salted caramel and toffee apples with a lovely spiciness from the oak, before the woodsmoke and peat kick in. It becomes syrupy sweet and creamy, which is a pleasant surprise.The finish is the trump card, for that is truly good. Medium long, a touch smoky and warm with some hazelnuts and toffee at the death.Dragon Legend refers to the legend of Sigurd, a folk hero who received wisdom by drinking the blood of the defeated dragon Fafnir. Oh, well. Nice, typical HP that certainly does what it should as entry level malt. Thanks, Manny!"
3743,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"This is was I call a good session dram, simple profile but it works well, none of the usual Highland Park Heather up front.Sweet orange smoke, peat, chocolate, a few toffee, notes, date slices, pruneThe peat mixes with toffee and a little caramel with some syrupy sweetness.There is some spice arriving, quite delicate and it adds to the overall juiciness of the profile.The sherry and peat mix well together and the peat is at the right level to compliment the profile.At first I thought this was on the short side finish wise but actually its all quite subtle with a nice sweetness."
3744,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"It's sweet, honey, salted caramel, floral, peaty! It's very nice! Better than the standard 12YO and IMO better than the Valkyrie! Smooth finish!"
3745,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"Nice NAS HP in a good price, better than Valkyrie, VOT Raven and 12yo.Peat, caramel, vanilla, waxy apple, honey, citruses and salt.Sweet fruits, salted caramel, peat, wood smoke, antique skin and spicy oak.Medium length, bittersweet, smoky."
3746,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"More full-bodied, sherried and peaty than the Valkyrie, but less fruity. The first BFYB HP in a long time.Caramel, raspberry, peat, vanilla, apple, cherry and malt.Typical HP peat. Chocolate, cherry, apple, toffee and malt.Milk chocolate, peat, toffee and hazelnut."
3747,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"Slightly smoky and quite fruity, plum, raisins, sweet lemon rind, mild liquorice, toffee, a little heather honey and a hint of tobacco and spent matches.A thin body, but tastewise it's pretty close to the nose with the plums, raisins and citrus, also liquorice, toffee, some chocolate, black pepper, clove and toasted oak.Medium length: warming, a continuation of the development, raisins, chocolate and toffee, toasted wood and a fading sharpness of spent matches."
3748,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"RATING: 86pts – |83 – 86 (B) → Good| — Not a “must”, but a nice-to-have.The nose has very interesting aroma that dominated by notes of scrambled eggs followed with vanilla cream.The taste is pretty HP-ish and has a profile of smoked citrus fruits, popcorn and spicy tangerines.The taste is medium lenght and pretty dry with touches of sweet spices, dried fruits and some spicy oakiness."
3749,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"Another cheap and nasty whisky from HP, but better than than the 12 y/o 'Honour'. Why do they sell such crap at such a low price and then market stupidly expensively NAS 'Valkeries Nipples clamp Cask' in silly carved longboat packaging. About time some Directors were sacked. Maybe they should focus on making decent whisky at a reasonable price ?Sardines, smoked anchovy, dipped in quickly seasoned sherry cask, linseed oil. really not good.sweetish, new make spirit (some 3 y/o here) - nice rounded mouth feel, bitter burn.bitter, not nice. The kind of whisky you want to throw the glass away and pour something better. Why do HP bother. WTF has this got to do with dragons?"
3750,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"Now and again you do come across a really good NAS, not just in taste but in price also and this is one of them.A real nutty nose and butter, which would make it peanut butter I suppose. That HP smokiness is just lingering about letting other things take centre stage. Freshly popped runner beans, naked natural bar, stinging nettles, Kiwi fruit and old polished wood.The spice and the smoke mixes very well and there are offshoots of liquorice and dry roasted nuts. Can't fault the 43.1% it's spot on I would say. In fact you can imagine them at the distillery saying 43 just isn't there, a tiny bit more and it will be perfect. You never know it could have made the world of difference. Sometimes when I am out and about in the spring I will pick young stinging nettle leaves and eat them as I walk and this reminds me of them.The finish is medium to long. The spiciness holds the longest. Normally you get a bit of dryness but not here. The smokiness has the last laugh on the death."
3751,Highland Park Dragon Legend,"Scrambled eggs with vanilla, smoked citruses, toasted bread, popcorn and tangerines. RATING: 86pts - [n22,t21,f22,b21] → |86-89: Remarkable|"
3752,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,"very slightly peated Highland Park - rock solid and interesting complex on the nose. 'Spicy Viking Warrior' fits perfectly with this whisky.  In terms of flavor, it is more of a summer whisky, since the light and rather tropical flavors are in the foreground.  Since this is a one-liter bottle, you can also experiment with cocktails / long drinks.light (peat) smoke. Vanilla and light sweetness. Somewhat fruity-citrus-like, in the direction of pineapple and orange as well as ripe mango and bananas depending on the shape of the day. Some caramel and butterscotch; reminiscent of Werther's real candy. Behind the light smoke, I also find the typical HP heather, but only very subtly. I would place the spicy in the direction of white pepper, but there are a few other spicy aromas that are difficult to grasp. But it is good on the nose.soft and sweet. More smoke in taste. Spices push through more; the peppery note from the nose can also be found here - 'warming'. Something citrusy (orange / lemon) and vanilla. Nutty-oily, it gets a little (coffee) tart at the back (but still pleasant). I now have the salt association, which some describe in the finish, while sipping and remaining out for a long time; Interesting!rather medium length with an oak note. Vanilla & some peat smoke. Spices - but not as strong anymore. Very light malt note."
3753,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,"Malty on the nose, hay and some (light) fruit (mirabelle plums?). In addition, minimal smoke. The impressions from the nose are reflected in the mouth. In addition, some pepper. Overall relatively light and thin. More smoke in the finish, slightly sweet and fruity behind. Easier and more boring than the 12 year old. Grade: 2"
3754,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,"Another one of those ""not really bad but forgettable b/c there are so many other similar bottles"" HP travel retail bottling. Same btw. with Bunnahabhain which make it even worse as a normal man can't pronounce the gaelic name concoctions."
3755,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,"Aroma: Fruity pineapple and lemon followed by oak aromas and piquant wood smoke. Taste: First smoky with notes of vanilla, then the freshness of lemon peel opens up. Finish: Long-lasting combination of vanilla sweetness and smokiness."

3757,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,
3758,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,"First, camphorated ointment. Then an iodized freshness. Acacia honey. Or is it eucalyptus? When you break a eucalyptus leaf in half. Peat is powerful, but it doesn't stop the rest from blossoming. Good balance. Very syrupy honey on the palate, but it's a bit light. Then bitterness rises. Quite strong finish, which is surprising with a minimum alcohol level. A little charcoal, but a bitterness sets in. It's relatively short. https://ilikesky2020.blogspot.com/2020/05/highland-park-einar-warrior-series-40.html"
3759,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,
3760,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,"Herbal, grassy, some gentle smoke, a little spice tickles at the nostrils, an almost flowery sweetness with time.With water - sweeter malty tone, almost sugarySoft smoke initially before developing and filling the mouth a little more, gently charred oak, a little weak and watery.With water - oak is fuller.Short/medium, smoke lingers but gets woody like chewed pencil, walnut aftertaste.With water - medium/long, a shadow of initial finish"
3761,Highland Park Einar  The Warrior Series,"Wins on the nose but loses it all again in the mouth.Notes from a 2 year open bottle below halfpoint. Seems to have opened up and settled down somewhat over that time. Would probably score a few points lower freshly opened, but this is strictly based on memory as I have no second bottle of this.First off spices, namely pepper, white pepper, then some grass, honey and caramel. Despite being only 40% the alcohol does nip a bit here. Then comes the young oak with a bit of vanilla and even some spearmint. Not too far from HP10 here.Mildy grassy, honeyed cereal, bit of oak and vanilla, peppery, spicy and alcoholic nip - again only @ 40% - cardboard. Pretty one dimensional and not up to par with the nose.Pepper, chili, cardboard - medium long on the ""afterburner""."
3762,Highland Park Full Volume,"A very beautiful highland park. With the character, they should simply bet on bourbon barrels much more often.Flowery sweetness, lemon drops, vanilla, fresh hay, frosting, a little mineral to maritime, a bit ashy in the backgroundSweet, more vanilla than in the nose, very creamy, perfect alcohol, effervescent powder, again a bit mineral, no bitternessHere are very light oak bitterness, very Springbank-like, beautiful mineral, the citrus notes are again very present, longer finish, without overstraining"
3763,Highland Park Full Volume,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deA fresh symbiosis of sweet, fruity and floral aromas stands out from my glass. Freshly squeezed lemon juice, cereals, mineral aromas and beautiful vanilla notes are additionally supported by light fruits, which easily drift off into the tropical spectrum. Pears, apricots, sugared pineapple, mangoes and a hint of blossom honey are perceptible. Hidden deep in the background is a tender smoke flag, which reminds me a little bit of cigar or pipe smoke. The alcohol (47.2%) makes itself felt very easily in the nose at first.Very creamy and intense. A wonderful sweetness runs down the cheeks, while on the tip of the tongue a delicate Pfeffrigkeit sets in and causes a slight tingle. Plenty of vanilla, citrus fruits, grains, unripe oranges, pineapple, mangoes and coconuts give the malt an enormous freshness and a sweet-tropical fruitiness. The alcohol content fits perfectly in terms of taste, the harmony and balance of the Highland Park is simply very good. The variety of flavors also gains in depth: mineral notes, hints of herbs, pleasant oak and fine cigar smoke set in the background a nice contrast to the sweet fruit.Medium long, sweet-spicy and warm. Slightly peppery and with many bright fruits, the well-balanced finish starts. Again I find citrus fruits, apricots, vanilla and mineral notes. The beautiful cigar smoke gains a little strength, but remains more in the background. Herbs and spicy oak let the malt slowly fade away and leave a minimal bitterness on the palate."
3764,Highland Park Full Volume,"Another quality malt from HP and this was a sample courtesy of Peatbogger. If you are looking for a high quality fruity malt, look no further.Sweet, and this time I mean sweet as in confectionery. Pear drops, vanilla, rhubarb and custard. More pear, in fact lots of pear. Really nice, i would never guess this was a HP. Creme brulee and banana on white bread.Everything on the nose just continues on the taste and it's fresh and vibrant. Fruit cocktail explosion. The 47% is just about spot on. It's funny because the flavours almost hold back and then all of a sudden bang, there you go I was just teasing you.The finish is amazing. It's like a cake throwing fight at the back of the tongue or I've just been whacked by Bugsy Malone."
3765,Highland Park Full Volume,"StoryFor musicians, amps and equalisers maintain critical balance at high volume by finetuning musical frequencies – at Highland Park, our Master Whisky Maker, Gordon Motion, does a similar job. FULL VOLUME was created using 100% ex-bourbon casks rather than our traditional sherryseasoned ones. During 1999, a combination of 481 casks – 200 litre barrels and 250 litre hogsheads – were filled at strengths of between 63.6% and 63.7%. The whisky was filtered at just over 4 C and delivers flavours of creamy vanilla and sweet citrus fruits from the bourbon casks, balanced by Highland Park’s characteristic aromatic smokiness.(highlandparkwhisky.com)Vanilla | Coconut | Mango | Pineapple | Cedar Wood | Lemon peel | Vanilla pods | Light smokeLight straw, clear and bright (average colour tint 6.5)"
3766,Highland Park Full Volume,"Without losing the thought of the ""full volume"", it is a 1A bourbon whisky! You shouldn't make the mistake of expecting something voluminous from this name. It definitely isn't. But a flowery Bourbon aged 17 with very good school grades. He deserves my full respect. This unfavorable name was certainly the only mistake in this edition. Because even the black gloss lacquer bottle looks extremely strong on the shelf.Wonderful summer nose with fresh lemon biscuits and a delicate hint of vanilla smoke. The herb flower meadow comes through slightly minerally and together with a light trail of smoke it then has a delicately maritime effect, as expected.The texture is exactly mine. Everything that belongs to bourbon whisky unfolds here. Very compact, it delivers clear vanilla butter biscuit notes with lots of lemon and round light oak pepper without missing notes. I really like that it stays so comfortable without hitting it. Actually, it does exactly the opposite of what the name suggests on the bottle. I am fully convinced of this palate and the transition is wonderfully harmonious.Medium to rather short. It ends with a mineral mix with a little wood and malty biscuits. But this bottle could make it on my shelf forever. I may still improve these notes. ... can he still manage the magic 88? :)"
3767,Highland Park Full Volume,"Beautiful highland park with a lot of coconut, combined with vanilla, everything coated in a light smokiness. A really great whisky."
3768,Highland Park Full Volume,"A fresh 18 year old citrus candy.  You can sniff for a long time and always gain new impressions, very complex in aroma. The taste continues what you have already smelled. Especially sweet citrus, orange and spices. An honest guy. Which is also very complex and a lot of fun.Fresh citrus notes, light orange notes to ripe juice oranges, the smoke is very delicate and far away, vanilla paired with sweet cream. Various spices with clove in the background. Generally citric, fresh, sweet.First sweet citrus fruits, then full volume with juicy oranges, sour fruit notes and slightly bitter grapefruit, from which the oak with spices and pleasantly sparkling pepper develops. The alcohol is perfectly integrated.Sparkling oak, bitter fruit notes, some vanilla, very light smoke at the end. Medium to long finish."
3769,Highland Park Full Volume,"Really good 100% ex-bourbon matured Highland Park. I haven't been the biggest fan of their OB expressions recently, but I thought the flavors in this bottling were nice. P.s. not sure what ""full volume"" means but this was not aggressive at all. Should've bottled it at cask strength with a name like that.⁣⁣Shame the marketing department keeps shoving this gimmicky shit down our throats. Just stop. Please.⁣⁣87/100"

3771,Highland Park Full Volume,"With a name like ""Full Volume"" I anticipated a cask strenght bottling, but 47,2% feels very right for this.It's the same age but less than half the price of ""The Light"".That one is 52,9%, so you get less alc strenght, but double the volume of a better whisky for the same money.""Full Volume"" may not be such a bad name after all ;-)It's HP, but rather more fresh and bright.Honey sweet lemon drops.Peach and pineapple juice.Hint of vanilla and deep down a little smoke.Sweet on yellow and white fruit.Peppery spice from the get go.Half way the oak takes over and it gets more dry and a bit tannic bitterness.Good length with a nice warmth of spice.In my opinion it's a little bit too dry/bitter to be in tune with it's sweetness.None the less, a pleasant whisky."
3772,Highland Park Harald  The Warrior Series,"Good representative of the ""Warrior series"". Much better than EINAR and SVEIN. Convinced by its very tasty, mild sweetish character. In the nose and in the taste a lot of honey, caramel, vanilla and subtle oak. Very delicate and well tuned. For then 70 € way too expensive. For just under 50 € a good buy recommendation."
3773,Highland Park Harald  The Warrior Series,"A very good daily dram, lightly peated with honey and vanilla notes, the best in the warriors series. surely not worth the €80 but with the new pricing around €50 its a great deal that you won't regret"

There is mild, but perceptible smoke beneath everything.starts spicy again. Cinnamon, pepper, clove, cardamom and coriander seed. In addition a lot of aromatic woods, without a trace of bitterness. Sweet, cooked fruits that are reminiscent of the 25-year-old. By no means a young whisky. Herbal, herbal smoke and dark honey, very typical Highland Park notes pour into the mouth. In the finish black tea with orange zest and cough drops.Velvety dense, salted caramel and warm wood rise after swallowing again in the throat."
3783,Highland Park Ragnvald  The Warrior Series,"Once again a totally overpriced Highland Park from a series which is thought in my opinion more to collect than to drink.  The nose is incredibly weak ... Also in the taste and the finish are (as I find) not many notes to find and the notes you find are not very pronounced and flat!  The only positive is the heather in the taste and finish ... because this is very well integrated.  In a nutshell 85 pointsVery flat, slightly well integrated heather, slightly floral notes, I would have estimated at 40%, totally speakingHoney, Floral, HeatherVery short, heather, honey"

In the direct duel of the Vikings, the Thorfinn beats the Ragnvald but something of the simple head and spread his guts in the area.herbaceous-spicy, a little smoke, later strong malt, vanilla and caramel.

3790,Highland Park Ragnvald  The Warrior Series,"Finally a really great NAS in the Warrior Series, though unfortunately the price is too exaggerated!Refined and soft. Sherry, vanilla, fruits, honey, spices and leather. Over time, mint and citrus.Sweet, oily, malty, smoky. Honey, vanilla, cocoa, pepper and nutmeg, herbals.Long, spicy, fruity, smoky."
3791,Highland Park Ragnvald  The Warrior Series,"Not surprisingly, the price is once again exaggerated, but the Ragnvald is by far the strongest representative of this series to date and definitely one of the better Highland Park NAS.  The nose I like really good, the taste comes Malt not quite in this plane - but without falling off brutally. A beautiful Highland Park, which is just - as often - offered at starl inflated prices.At first, it reminds me a lot of the Highland Park 30. Juicy oranges and fruit notes mix with spicy impacts and some heather. No alcoholic sharpness, wonderfully soft and yet powerful in the bouquet. The used sherry casks are noticeable and give the Ragnvald a pleasant ""juicy"" aroma. Later, it adds a distinct vanilla note - very pretty! From the typical smoke at Highland Park in the nose only the hint of a trace.  That with the aromatic nose can still be found at Highland Park. Let's see if the taste can match this time.Mild and soft, surprisingly oily mouthfeel. The Ragnvald rolls over the taste buds and leaves a strong spicy veil. The influence of the American and European barrels is now becoming clear, and the slight influence of smoke is now more noticeable than in the nose. The fruit notes, however, are clearly in the background, which I think is a pity. Overall still kept pretty sweet, but they do not manage so decidedly in the foreground, so that a sweet and spicy mixture is created. Reminds me of some macha tea with honey.Stronger than in the mouth, this is ensured by a subtle pepper note. Otherwise, here too strong spicy with slightly dry tendency. Are there any fruit notes? At best remotely to guess, here is the Ragnvald rather floral on the move - but in the end the smoke shows up a bit stronger and intensifies the rather medium-long finish."
3792,Highland Park Sigurd  The Warrior Series,"[August, 2019] When ""Sigurd"" was released I immediately liked it, by the way - it was the first NAS release that I really liked. This was because ""Sigurd"" is of the truly old Traditional Scotch style with low wood or wine impact but a beautiful mix of malt, wine and wood flavours in a close-to-perfection balance. I am not sure why this is rated so low here on WB but maybe the later batches were not as good (often the quality goes south after the first batch, unfortunately). Luckily I saved a bottle from the batch coded L0214S L21 16/06 and I am curious if I still like it after all those years......and I do! To me this is neither thin nor lacks any ""oomph"" but maybe I own a different batch (see second review below) or a different taste (or both). To be honest, this could be an ""everyday dram"" to me - it is both interesting to explore and dangerously quaffable.The colour is quite dark at burnished so they added more sherry casks to this batch, most probably. I use the big spheric blender's glass to nose it and the first sniff offers a quite impressive and complex set of different aromas in this perfect balance that I remember. The typical HP trademark flavours are accompanied by clean but not dominating sherry aromas and a shy spicy wooden note. That is what I like! Out of the blender's glass the nose is quite intense and after some breathing the fruits, honeys, toffee and sherry is enriched by herbs (camphor, eucalyptus), freshly oiled woods, creams wax and some nuts. Take your time (and the right glass) with this nose and you will be rewarded - ooh, and do not forget to warm the dram to body temperature with your hands!The taste is nicely layered on sweet fruits and molten barley sugars first with winey sherry flavours jumping in very fast. Next are the spices before the honeys sweeten the taste again. Later some fine oily and toffee notes come and go as does a touch of liquorice. No dear Serge, this is not thin (but maybe you tasted a different batch). The dram is greatly chewable and I strongly suggest to do so as this releases much more additional flavours, among them milk chocolate, mocha and crème brûlée.The dram arrives warming and with a creamy coating on the palate without distracting moments. The finish is long and adds more honeys and spices (peppers) without any bitter or drying moments. Again I do not think this is thin or lacks the ""oompf"", to be honest. But modern style whisky lovers might see this differently which is absolutely okay. Water is not needed on this anyhow low-proof dram."
3793,Highland Park Sigurd  The Warrior Series,"[August, 2019] ""Curiosity killed the whisky drinker"" - hopefully not, because I am too curious to let this ""Sigurd batch issue"" pass untested. I screened my cellar and luckily I found a different ""Sigurd"" batch coded L0093T L21 03/04 so it is bottled ten month later than the 16/06 (in 2014, most probably). Of course I cannot resist to crack this bottle open and do a head-to-head of these two batches...Wow, what an eye-opener! This 03/04 batch is significantly weaker (by five points) than the excellent 16/06 batch. It lacks the delicious sherry flavours which hide shy in the background and it shows unpleasant old wood impact instead (bitter notes, cardboardy-ness). I never thought that the differences within the same product from about the same time can be that huge (didn't the master blender check every batch?) - 16/06 is excellent, 03/04 average only (at best). I am very glad I did this head-to-head and I can easily imagine that later batches are even weaker than 03/04...The colour of the 03/04 is one shade paler at deep copper than the 16/06 at burnished (less sherry casks?). The noses offer basically the same profile but 03/04 is significantly less impressive and complex than 16/06. The sherry notes are rather shy and hide in the background while the HP malt aromas center around heather honey and autumn floral aromas only missing the herbal notes completely (there is bitter tea instead, and more tannins). There are much less fruits in the 03/04 too, unfortunately. This is a three points difference in favour of 16/06,The taste of the 03/04 is less sweet (again fewer fruits) and less winey than 16/06 and it turns quite bitter after some chewing (the wood grows stronger). Oops, this is not as balanced and less tasty than 16/06 - what a difference! This is astonishing four points weaker than 16/06. Again, water is not needed on this low-proof dram.The initial mouthfeel of the 03/04 is warming but less coating than 16/06 with a bitter-drying moment (tannins at work). The finish is just of medium length (16/06 was long). It adds some chocolatey impressions and even more bitter flavours (like tea that steeped too long). There is an unpleasant drying cardboardy feeling towards the end of the finish too, obviously they added some casks with rather old woods to this batch. This is even a six points difference to the fine 16/06 finish (that was great at 91 points)."
3794,Highland Park Sigurd  The Warrior Series,"Overall, very pleasant flavors, unfortunately too light. The smoke from the nose is not found in the taste and hardly on the finish again. I would like to try it with 50%, in batch strength it must be stunning! Nevertheless, a very pleasing summer dram.Very nice smoke, which blends well with grass and fruit flavors. Reminiscent of a fruit cocktail with pineapple, papaya and mango, I can not grab fruit individually. Grainy maltiness also plays a role in the background. Overall, very light, delicate aromas. As the temperature increases, the aromas become unusually noticeably stronger. The fruit notes shift in the direction of dried fruits, raisins are added and the grain note is also stronger. Some caramel plays along.The delicate fruitiness continues in the taste. He is clearly honey sweet with delicate to quite clear oak notes. Overall, very oily, but unfortunately a bit flat.In the finish, which is short to medium in length, appears something new, difficult to grasp: sweet and bitter fruit, very attractive. Edelherb chopped fresh mango, the pleasant fruit acid also reminds a bit of currant sticks. This fruitiness actually stops longest."
3795,Highland Park Sigurd  The Warrior Series,"RATE FOR BATCH L0214S L21 16/06 (batch number is noted at the back of the front label)I can absolutely relate to HS305 comments.The two different batches L0093T L21 03/04 (scores 86 with me) and L0214S L21 16/06 (scores 91 with me) can not deny beeing of the same family, but 16/06 is so far ahead. Who knows how many batches of Sigurd are around but likely a variation is there if everyone and I would be surprised if the batches got better with time.Thus the divergence in rates here can be explained easily. Just too bad, that the WB entry was not made on the basis of different batches, i.e. as done with Laddies.

3798,Highland Park Sigurd  The Warrior Series,"completely different character than the big brother, the Ragnvald. Still very tasty and does not fall off next to the 18 year old.Tropical fruity, that comes as a surprise. The classic aroma of smoking hay and herbs lies as a delicate carpet under notes of a little immature mango, green banana and buttery papaya. Definitely untypical up to here. Some essential woody oils, aromatic nuttiness and warm woodDoes not fall off the nose, dark caramel, conifer and oriental spices. Spicy-floral notes of black tea, lavender and thyme add to the already present in the nose very present ""yellow"" fruitiness, plus orange juiceCinnamon and milk coffee"
3799,Highland Park Sigurd  The Warrior Series,"Although not in several ways not my style, great balanced, delicious, etc.Strong hay, pineapple, caramelized banana, mango, brown sugar and a handful of peat and heather, off the last note really HP atypical but very interesting and makes you want moreCinnamon, fine oak, lemon zest, some peat, lavender and clove, a few of the exotic notes from above also here in the mouth, very consistent everythingMedium long, dry peaty-spicy, very pleasant"
3800,Highland Park Sigurd  The Warrior Series,"Butter biscuits, vanilla, honey, caramel, herbs, the typical HP smoke.  Then dark chocolate and a jet of oak.  Everything was very set and mild ... too mild and styled for my taste.  More turns would definitely do him good."
3801,Highland Park Sigurd  The Warrior Series,Great Malt ... complex and a bit off the mainstream. Unfortunately too expensive!  85/100Grassy-flowery with pleasantly light smoke. An unknown note in midfield ... is the heather? Alcoholic. Nut and coffee as well as distinct roasted aromas.Nut chocolate with honey and caramel ... plus some pepperMedium long and sweet
3802,Highland Park Spirit of the Bear,"Moderately smoky, very ""drinkable"" whisky that lacks strength. Another boring release with no age indication.Fresh, slightly smoky, with a high content of hints of malt and citrus (grapefruit, pomelo).Lightly salty, peppery, smoky, with a lemon note.Medium duration, completely repeating the taste palette."
3803,Highland Park Spirit of the Bear,"Spicy and sweet HP with little smoke - I think it's great, even if the nose promises a little more than the taste. I find PLV fair and for me a very pleasant, delicious EveryDayDram.very light smoke (tends to be more like campfire smoke, even if there is still something very medical here). Fruity, for me a banana aroma is dominant. Seasoning (towards nutmeg and somehow ginger) and sherry notes. Slight hint of vanilla in the background. Later some red dried fruit and a little more sweetness. I find it harmonious and balanced, the smoke is not superficial, but rather easily integrated. The aromas develop a little in the air.very soft and sweet. Seasoning (nutmeg and ginger spiciness) occurs nicely. Seasoning persists for a long time with a slight oak note and sherry aroma. Fruit retreats somewhat. The second sip makes it even sweeter, but seasoning remains.Wort stays with oak and sherry for a long time, gets drier out the back. Very light smoke. Very light coffee-bitter aftertaste."
3804,Highland Park Spirit of the Bear,"Highland Park's Travel Retail series was inspired by the various wildlife that were of great importance to the Vikings.

3812,Highland Park Svein  The Warrior Series,"[December, 2018] Just a short review of a sample (I would never buy a full bottle of such modern NAS stuff without trying it before)......and it was a good decision, again! This is a boring and unimpressive modern malt that lacks almost everything a Scotch single malt release should offer. Not worth any money (go for blends instead, they offer more value for the buck). Such releases are the undertaker's of the current malt whisky boom...The colour is jonquiripe corn and the nose shows a modern ""designed"" whisky profile with mainly immature mashy aromas that are somewhat camouflaged by excessive wooden notes. Boring and unimpressive - why should I sniff at such stuff?The taste is sugary sweet (rather industrial sugar, not the fine barley sugars I adore) and ... of course, woody. Cheap stuff, distilled and matured in a hurry to maximise output (and profit to the owners, an investment group) and marketed for the quick buck. I guess, warrior Svein would not be amused to read his name on this release...The whisky arrives with almost no mouthfeel on the palate (neither warming nor coating) but with drying-astringent moments from heavy woods. The finish is short as a lightning and leaves no lasting impression beside the drying-astringent tannins again. Water just flattens the dram (further). To be honest, I flushed the rest of this sample down the drain..."
3813,Highland Park Svein  The Warrior Series,
3814,Highland Park Svein  The Warrior Series,"A decent OB. I'm not a fan of newer HP OB's at all, but this is quite OK. Better than the new 18-yo IMHO and on-par with the 2001 1L Travel Retail, but less sulphury and with less smoky notes.A mix of yellow and red fruit, ginger dipped in vanilla desert (Dutch vla), a sulphury oaky wood note, I'm missing the whim of smoke present in a lot of HP OB'sWeak at first,then honey sweetness, vanilla and caramel, some oak on the sides of the tongue, then some coffee and dark chocolate notes on the back of the tongue. Ginger notes everywhere.Medium long/Short. Keeping the coffee and dark chocolate notes, a warm (alcohol) feeling flows through the mouth front to back. Nothing else really."

At the end a wonderful combination of oak with a light tone of Orkney heather peat.As soon as the whisky touches my tongue, I immediately taste smoke. Vanilla and a pinch of white pepper. Here too at the end, after swallowing, hints of Orkney heather peat and oak.Medium-long and dry. Lots of oak tannins and vanilla cake."
3818,Highland Park Svein  The Warrior Series,"Seriously, I rather despise this for being one of the endless HP nas bottles that for its actual taste which is alright. Rough around the edges, but the 40% abv. don't come across too watery, also no real off notes and some peaty-/earthiness, too. Nothing you'd need on a bar but wouldn't pass one if offered."

A hint of salt and some sherry influence?Malty, fruit appears with stewed apple, dried apricot and orange peel. Some salted caramel. Wood forward with oak, vanilla and pepper.Mellow yet rather tannic with the oak sticking around. More milk chocolate with anise, fennel and caraway poking through. Cherries with a metallic glint and a slither of smoke."
3822,Highland Park Triskelion,"Nose:  Apricot, apple, sherry-nutty, honey and some vanilla, very pleasant and promising, nice light fruits with floral spring notes, in the background an interesting dark, somewhat mineral, note with a slight acidity  I like the nose very much. Really exciting and complex.  Taste:  Oh no, it falls off in taste. What a water! Oh dear! HP, what's the point? Even though the nose was so fine, the taste is terribly bland. A little honey goes with light spice, nuts and watery forest berry thinning juice. There is a noticeable lack of power in taste.  finish:  The finish and the aftertaste is actually boring. Warm tap water with minimally diluted whisky taste.  Conclusion / points:  After the excellent nose, the big disappointment. I don't need it in the glass anymore.  83/100 (without a nose my judgment (for a HP) would be devastating !!)"
3823,Highland Park Triskelion,"It is not very clear why some people rate him highly. The most common NAS release. Not particularly outstanding. Beautiful bottle and box + collab story. The taste and aroma are poor. Considering the price, we immediately understand that we are faced with a typical example of a marketing trap. Don't fall into it!"

3827,Highland Park Triskelion,"A nice NAS of Highland Park. With this they show that an age is not always necessary, but the price can be called considerable. For much less you already have the beautiful HP 18 yrsOrange, apricot, currants and raisins, honey, herbs. I can't detect the familiar smoke of HP.Again orange, apricot, currants and raisins, honey and herbs. Also nuts and berries. The well-known smoke of HP is certainly present in the taste. Yummy!The finish is long and spicy. The smoke lasts extremely long. A nice whisky, but oh well, that price."
3828,Highland Park Triskelion,"An interesting release, but the smokiness is felt only on the aftertaste.

3832,Highland Park Valfather  Viking Legend,"I found this one too weak to be really enjoyable, lacked profile and flavour all round.Save your money and get the Dragon Legend which is cheaper & much better.Some pretty inactive casks in the mix I feel?"
3833,Highland Park Valfather  Viking Legend,"The nose starts with that typical highland park peat. Floral, sherry and a nutty scent. Obvious walnut and dried fruit. As the whisky opens in the glass it becomes clear that the peat is slightly more powerful than I am used to from a highland park.I take the first sip and so hey! That's a whole bucket more peat than I expected. For a moment I was taken aback by it, but I pick myself up again and take another sip to explore the whisky further. The whisky is nicely balanced with the nose. Has a pepper, soft sherry influences, floral, plums, raisins, dried fruit but also certainly fresh fruit such as an apple and a pear and a wood taste. Yet something strange happens in my mouth with this whisky… the whisky starts out greasy but suddenly turns into an incredibly dry mouthfeel. Very special. But very welcome.The finish has lots of pepper, some oiliness, nuts and that earthy peat."

3835,Highland Park Valfather  Viking Legend,"Thanks to ronnholt for this sample.Around what I've come to expect from a NAS HP.Not too complex, but somehow saved by being bottled at a higher ABV which delivers the flavours favourably.Compaired to the 10 and 12 there is a little more smoke, more peaty. It's also a bit sweeter on the sherry.Other than that, the usual HP notes; apple, citrus, heather honey.It's got both similarities and slight differences from the core range, almost like a mix of 10 & 18.A bit too much alc up front, but then it's at a decent 47% so I'm not complaining.Starts of with a sweet and very nice rich caramel chocolate in combination with red fruits.Initially not much smoke, but it emerges midway as it gets a bit dryer. However I wouldn't call it peaty.Medium lenght. Wood and smoke, drying and slightly bitter."
3836,Highland Park Valfather  Viking Legend,The third and final bottling of Highland Park's Viking Legend series in collaboration with Jim Lyngvild.
3837,Highland Park Valfather  Viking Legend,"Pretty meh overall. Not as good as Valkyrie or Valknut for me. Both of those just have more going on.Slightly sour fruity peat. Lots of green apples, some mild honey, and light caramel. Plenty of autumn leaves and heather. There’s certainly a good amount of smoke here, though nothing like real heavily-peated malt. Some slightly ashy wood smoke, then smoked salmon, then the particular spiced and caramelized flavour of smoked pork. Some marzipan and Scottish oat cakes.Fairly light texture. Only slightly sweet on the arrival, with lots of green plants, herbs (particularly basil), and light peat. It gets ashier, as more green wood smoke comes in, along with iodine and more basil. Honey sweetness shines through, and there’s a salted butter note on the back end.Medium-short. The green apples return here, along with basil, and honey. Lingering ash and iodine. Some lime and challah bread."

3842,Highland Park Valknut  Viking Legend,"Scandinavian StonesThe Highland Park Valknut is the second whisky in the Viking Legend series, with a design by Danish designer Jim Lyngvild. The Valknut, the symbol on the label, consists of three triangles that flow into each other, as can often be seen on old Scandinavian stones. It refers to the god Odin. It is said that this HP is more smoky than the standard releases.The nose is quite coastal, but I would not really call it smoky. It’s a good nose, don’t get me wrong. Very clean and sweet on vanilla, yellow apples and peach with a hint of sultanas and flowery honey. Heather and even a touch of smoked salmon. Nice.The body is fine, almost creamy. Lots of vanilla and apples before some maritime notes and peat appear. Yes, it becomes pretty smoky now. Good balance. Seaweeds and peach go hand in hand. This is very pleasant and quaffable.The finish is long, on sweet malt and liquorice, with a smoky touch and a bit of zest from pink grapefruit at the death.While not overly complex, this is more outspoken than the recently tasted Dragon Legend. Around 65 EUR. Thanks for the sample, Manny."
3843,Highland Park Valknut  Viking Legend,"Simple but does the job. Can’t complain.Sea breeze, fresh and clean. With time raw cookie dough with vanilla chips. With time a soft touch of raisin comes in.Vanilla sweetness, the classic HP heather smoke creeping in. With time a maritime presence starts to sneak in.Hint of coal smoke and some burnt wood. Creamy vanilla long finish."
3844,Highland Park Valknut  Viking Legend,"Not a big sherry impact here, clearly all refill. Not very complex either, but it does have a really nice balance and a lot of taste which makes this a dram that I can keep pouring all evening without boring me. When comparing it to the Svein, Valkyrie and Dragon Legend, it really stands out how much more aromatic this one is. Especially in comparison to the first two.Right away that typical NAS HP nose, mixing that particular light peat with a vanilla cookie-like maltiness. Also a really present fruitiness of apple, yellow raisin and peach.The peat is slightly more present, but still balanced by those vanilla cookies and a considerable amount of apple.The peat becomes more liquorice-like and even more in the foreground, with that maltiness behind it."
3845,Highland Park Valknut  Viking Legend,"(Tasted 13.10.2021)Nose: Sweet honey and berries, mild peat smoke, a touch of heather. With air also toffee.

3846,Highland Park Valknut  Viking Legend,"(Tasted blind)NOSE: Sweet cedar wood, dried fruits, typical sherry cask notes. Also hints of smoke and sulphur. Later bourbon cask like notes appear; hints of vanilla and dried banana. (86-87p).TASTE:  The arrival is quite soft, with a touch of sweetness. Then dried fruits, then some (mild) wood tannins. Not very complex but quite nice nonetheless. (87p).EXIT: Sweetness, mild tannins, a slight bitter touch, mild pepper. Medium long aftertaste. (86-87p).OVERALL: Could this be a bourbon matured malt, finished in a refill sherry cask? Or a mix of bourbon and refill sherry cask matured malts? TOTAL SCORE 86 (87) points."

3851,Highland Park Valknut  Viking Legend,
3852,Highland Park Valkyrie  Viking Legend,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deIn the first few minutes I find the Highland Park slightly alcoholic (subtle stinging in the nose), but after ten to 15 minutes in the glass, the nose is much more pleasant. A summery freshness with bright fruits and plenty of honey caresses my nose tip. I see green apples, pears, apricots and citrus fruits, followed by plenty of vanilla and caramel. The background is always a pleasant smoke. Echoes of oak spiciness are already detectable, albeit very discreet. After a good 20 minutes, red fruits flash, fresh strawberries and raspberries push forward. Very complex - makes you want more!The mouthfeel is pleasantly oily and soft at the beginning, then a noticeable pepperiness begins at the tip of the tongue. The smoke is much more dominant than expected (for my taste more intense than the Highland Park 12 years), the fruit notes are still very cloudy. The second sip is dominated by smoke and pepperiness, the bright fruits, in combination with vanilla and honey, from the nose have (unfortunately) difficult to set flavor accents. Delicately bitter chocolate, leather and hints of red fruits make for a reasonably complex taste profile, even if it can not convince me 100% in terms of balance and harmony.With goodwill medium. The smoke also dominates the finish of the malt. The sweet, bright fruits can set a last exclamation point very quickly, but fade very fast. The oak notes are now spicy, a slight bitterness and a noticeable dryness in the mouth makes itself felt. Well."
3853,Highland Park Valkyrie  Viking Legend,"Very beautiful outer box and black glossy bottle. In the glass, it exudes a strong tropical fruit flavor, and at the same time there are some peaches, cantaloupe, caramel, sweeter chocolate, burnt wood and other flavors. The taste is based on fruit and caramel, coupled with Highland Park’s most distinctive honey-flavored smoke, the alcohol content plays a good role here, the body is very strong, and the taste is plump and round. Finish is medium to long, still fruity, caramel, and sweet smoky. The total taste is 86 points, which is obviously better than 12yo (but I think it is simply the difference in abv concentration in bottling, there should not be much difference in aging), but compared to the performance of 18yo, the gap is still a bit far. At its price, you can buy two bottles of 12yo in my area. Although it is worth it in terms of its performance, I would rather just add some money to buy 18yo for a better experience. The individual keeps a bottle as a decoration collection, because the outer box is very beautiful. The taste score is 86 points, and the price does not affect the score."
3854,Highland Park Valkyrie  Viking Legend,"The whisky has both more mature and younger components, as NAS already suggests. A pleasant, not too intrusive smoke note, which is stronger than in the standard bottlings. The light sulfur is not unpleasant, but gives the whisky more nuances. For what he offers, he is a bit overpriced, because I think the 12er better.Burning gum, wood sugar, dry herbs (rosemary and sage?); pleasant, slightly sulphurous notes, which, however, disappear after some time. Clearly sweet.First, the smoke comes in the form of a cold fireplace, while the whisky is quite sweet, burning gum is still a bit to feel, even the herbs clearly noticeable. A warm mouthfeel, the whisky gets lighter in the back with less fruit. Towards the end there is still a little caramel.Medium-long and smoky, woody, dry and at the same time sweet."

3856,Highland Park Valkyrie  Viking Legend,"It's interesting to see what HP has been throwing onto the market lately ...Caramel sweet and cream sauce, honey, milk chocolate. That's it but then for the beginning. Not unpleasant, but not really exciting. Caramel dominates, after a while comes in a good dose of vanilla and a malting note. A liquid toffee candy.A reflection of the nose: vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, honey. Slightly metallic. Over time, peppermint and cooling menthol. The heather, which can be seen in some HPs already in the nose, are only here on the tongue.

[September, 2009]  Together with friends I emptied another bottle that I bought for 37,50 Euro in February, 2007.[December, 2010]  Together with friends I emptied another bottle that I bought for 41 Euro in February, 2007.In my old rating system (ten scales that translate into WB points: 50 - 66 - 75 - 80 - 82,5 - 85 - 87,5 - 90 - 92,5 - 95) I scored it 82,5.  My notes state a nice sherry profile but with quite some flaws.  As there were not many better Imperial bottlings out there I usually served this one to visitors and friends.  But why bottled Allied such flawed stuff for their employees?"

3869,Inchgower 14-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"The fresh and fine nose is definitely the highlight of this bottling. On the palate, bitter and unbalanced, it is no longer a pleasure.A beautiful, fine, fresh maritime nose with tangy citrus notes. Oranges, limes, ginger, pepper, sea breeze, fresh wood, applesauce, apricots, hay.Slightly watery, slightly hot and yet quite intense on the palate. Vanilla, ginger, tannins, orange zest, pineapple, blood orange, oak spice, aniseed.Medium-long finish. Above all, the bitterness remains, along with a little oak spice and blood orange."
3870,Inchgower 14-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"A Speysider with a bit of a maritime strength. At first, it displays some fruit sweetness (apricot, apple pie, citrus), but soon reveals an oaky and slightly salted bitterness, already announced by the nose (bitter almonds). Also vanilla notes are present, given by the bourbon cask maturation, anyway the result is neither sweet nor smooth. It has its own character, bold and not immediately comforting for everyone, but surely interesting for anyone who likes to explore something a bit different."
3871,Inchgower 14-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"The scent of cardboard - not the annoying kind - quickly turns floral and soft. It has been (closed) in the closet for five years, waiting for the final judgment - keep it and sell it or not? Or not, so. The increase in value is negligible (see what I did there?) And the valuation on WB is not over the top. Okay, pop, so open now. 14 years old, at 43%. he's a smooth guy. Butterfat mouthfeel, trace of nuts and wood, a bitter edge in the aftertaste. There is something spicy in it, not very specific. It doesn't necessarily make me happy. Dry, dusty, now also cardboard in the aftertaste. I think that if you blended this with a sweet whisky like Glenmorangie 10YO, the combination would be more interesting than this whisky as a single malt. I will definitely give that a try, I still have 100 ml of that stuff somewhere. That said, maybe it's just me today - it wouldn't be the first time the whisky is more enjoyable the next time. Not a big deal for now, but I am disappointed. The second tasting is a bit better; there is a pleasant pepper in it - unfortunately the cardboard remains ubiquitous. This whisky is neither fruity nor very sweet; neither salty nor peaty; neither remarkable nor startling; what he is, I may know that the third time. We have had that third time now. Nuts, softly sweet, cardboard remains oxygenated for a month and a half now. I don't really believe in that myth either. Mild, friendly, minty entry-level whisky that can't really anger anyone. Unfortunately, I am not pleased either. 82 points."

The fruits only show once you've taken the first sip.Soft is understating it. Feels like the mildest 43% I've tasted yet.

Burning matches and dry wood chips. After the first sip of dark, malty, a few pickled plums, block malt. Boiled apples, vanilla sauce.For 43% surprisingly oily, butter, malt beer, for 14 years a good pile of old oak. Nutmeg, orange peel, green apples.Rather short, clearly bitter.

Invergordon is the only grain distillery in Scotland that cannot be found in the Lowlands. I have tried some older Invergordon before (25, 42 and 48 years old), but never such a young one. The expectations are, to be honest, quite low.The nose is fairly spirity and green, if you know what I mean. Reminds me a bit of candy sugar. Some coconut, but rather a chemical variety than the actual fruit. Gummi candy. It has a metallic side, as if it was poured from a can. A bit of gooseberries and some vanilla. Not very grand, I must say. On the contrary.The arrival is rather watery and astringent. Ouch, it even turns bitter and sour from the very start. Very alcoholic. The vanilla and gooseberries return and are joined by some white pepper, quinine and aniseed, only to fall completely apart.The finish is medium long, but sweet and sour, which is not very much to my liking. Well, this is one of the least interesting single grains I have tried so far. Not worthy of your time. It clearly needs a lot more time to develop."

I expected this one a little more agressive and sharp since it's just 10yo but it turned out to be friendly, easy drinkable and fresh. I do think in general this one is a little one sided and quite a typical/standard grain profile. Not much surprising in my opinion. but that is to be expected with such a young grain whisky.

A soft hint of vaguely earthy peat can be found in the back and there's this underlying tone of cloying caramel sweetness. There's also this smell of a room belonging to a child that moved out when they became an independent adult that hasn't been touched since. I compare it to stale rugs, dusty wood and old clothes. Honestly there's quite a bit going on here... Just not in a good way.Palate:Extremely watery arrival. Stale pond water, cardboard, orange pith, old used coffee grounds, wood glue, oak, motor oil, fries fried in old overused frying oil. I guess there's a pear note hidden away in there that's somewhat okay?Finish:Short. Charcoal, sappy wood, bitter, mint, lime zest.Overall:Just don't buy this allright. Pinky promise? Unless you're a masochist of course. Then by all means go ahead. In all seriousness though. This is probably one of the worst malts available in the category around €30.

3894,Isle of Jura 10-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Salty, faint smell of sweaty clothes (but a hint of perfume coming through). The sherry and bourbon casks are easy to pinpoint; vanilla and nuttiness come through in the down-to-earth nose. Concluding, the nose definitely doesn't ""jump out"" with loads of complex smells. Red wine, sheer smells of alcohol, pepper and grass are the final details of note. No sight of the peated influence, besides the 'sweaty' character, to be found yet.Pleasant oily, citric and sweet taste to start off with. Salted, pure chocolate is how I would characterize the next development. Then the grassy element comes through in the taste, just like it did in the nose. I can sense this whisky has some kind of peaty influence, but it barely shows in the nose or taste. Slightly mossy and bittery smoke perhaps, but that is about it. The PPM cannot be too high in this one, perhaps to keep the whisky accessible for a wide range of customers. Other noteworthy tastes are raisins, walnuts, nutmeg, black pepper and lots of more pure chocolate and coffee (reminds me most of a strong espresso). But it's all wrapped in only 40% alcohol content, so the full character of the whisky does not really show, neither with or without water. Something of a disappointment as all the tastes ""fly by"".Finish is - as pointed out here, and in reviews on other websites - quite bitter. I myself do not mind the finish being bitter, it is actually a surprising aspect of the whisky that makes it a slight bit more complex. It goes hand in hand with the espresso taste that I pointed out before. The oiliness sticks for a little while, not surprisingly long but I wouldn't say it's short either.

In fact i swapped glasses to see if that helped and I must say no not really. I also went out into the fresh air and that didn't help either. Really struggling to find red fruit notes as you would expect. There is something there but Phfffff! I'm not Sherlock Holmes.I was hoping for something totally different with the taste because it has happened in the past with others. Nothing going on with the nose but the taste saves it.

An old, ripe Jura always works and then the finish in sherry casks should not lead to disappointment. Conclusion in advance: A very interesting and very tasty after-work malt with memorable value due to its elegant courtesy. Only the finale is weak.Strikingly typical wet linen sherry notes plus Ritter Sport whole milk in the foreground. Behind some dried leather. Overripe wild blackberries lie on the forest floor and the cut wood from last year's forest work is next to it. A very pleasant sherry nose with a clear structure. But with that we ended up on the nose in the one-way street. Let's see if the palate can tell a little more about the 21 years in the barrel.Cautiously sweet and drooling, it starts with a bit of oak spiciness and looks deliciously tasty, ... yes, almost complex. Wonderful texture with a clear concept based on beneficial and warming. A palate that you won't soon forget. The Ralfy family is also fun. Respect to the master. Good barrel choice. Shortly before the transition, it slowly becomes bitter with herbs, but on the warming elegant side. I can't take in the moment of the exit. He's too quick in the final for me. Seems like that.Medium to short, it suddenly ceases to have an effect in the mouth as it is very drying. Then there is nothing left to describe. The mouth literally sticks together and stays dry. Not a particularly laudable finale for this proud age. However, the PLV considered it to be a clear buy recommendation, as it is a tasty, well-made sherry whisky and, at 21 years of age, not that expensive."
3922,Isle of Jura 21-year-old,"I have a weak spot for Jura since I’ve visited the island. It’s just a unique ambiance and quite an experience to live the life on such a small island. And no matter how short you’re there, your being treated like a local. This is something I relive every time I have a Jura whisky in my glass.Dough, walnut, cedar wood shavings, apricot, dried dates and plumbs, vanilla, toasted oak, stone and minerals. There are also earthy dirt like notes in a typical Jura way, because of the use of water that ran through peat grounds. Hints of very old leather are also present.The taste is gentle, soft and balanced. Sweet, earthy and savory. There is a slight bitterness as well. Dried fruits, vanilla sticks, cinnamon and dark chocolate. The palate focuses on the ‘dark’ side of sherry with wee fresh hints of the bourbon casks.Oak spices, leather, toasted oak. Also apricot and dates. The finish is of medium-long length. It ends very mineral-like with wet stones and dry savory hints of walnut. I like the style of Jura but I know it’s not a particularly popular distillery. This is one of those distilleries to visit first and then enjoy after. It really adds to the experience."

3926,Isle of Jura 21-year-old,"A really surprising and extremely exciting Jura. I really like the nose, but unfortunately the taste falls off a bit. There is simply no boom. Nevertheless: It is something different and has its own, somehow mystical character.Nice dark fruit notes spread, accompanied by a nice, persistent and slightly tart herbal note. After a few seconds in the glass, red berries are added, alternating with dry vanilla and woody caramel. With some red apple. Definitely feels 'mature'. Dessert like vanilla ice cream with hot raspberries, lightly sprinkled with spices and cocoa, comes to mind in places. In addition, every now and then I discover an exciting and surprising note that I would even describe as slightly maritime. The very independent (if not to say peculiar) herb impact with the sweet fruit and vanilla notes gives a really interesting and beautiful overall picture. Has something!First lies quite creamy on the tongue, then the herbs strike again! Pleasantly tart, somehow maritime with wet grass and damp wood. The vanilla flashes through every now and then, the fruits have disappeared. A bit tart chocolate spreads, is complemented by a touch of tart lemon peel. In principle, I would like that a lot despite the lack of fruit, especially the strong herbal note I find exciting. Nevertheless, the malt seems a bit flat to me here. If it's because of the (not even that low) 44%, it's because of something else ... I don't know. But here is just a little too little power behind it, even has a tendency to be one-sided. Unfortunately!Quite creamy, here a light, sweet fruity note shines through again. Chocolate with a relatively low cocoa content is noticeable, the sweetness is emphasized a little here. The herbal notes reappear and slowly bring the taste to an end with a delicate, tart woody note. Here maybe a touch of maritime with moist vegetation. The second sip is clearly more bitter, with 'dark' wood aromas. The herbs now appear slightly musty. Fancy!"

Gentle spices wade through on the tongue, fading into tasty jelly jujube candies in the finish.The bottled-in-bond qualification of this whiskey certainly helps and it is very drinkable and enjoyable, but if you are after a punch in the face with a bourbon, this is not it.Astringent, minerality and chemical, with very dry sherry appearing just before consumption.Fruity and mellow, oak and caramel, with a hint of vanilla and orange peels.Quite dry, with more fresh oak appearing alongside cinnamon, and surprisingly is quite long, which is a bonus. A light sweetness of lollies rides all the way to the end. Quite pleasant."

3951,Jack Daniel's Gentleman Jack,"Airfix glue, here I come! Back in the mists of time, the classic Old No. 7 was my first review. Does double filtration through charcoal make this Tennessee whiskey any better? Well, the nose is less rough and almost pleasant with notes of caramelized popcorn, syrup and nail polish. Is 'diabetic' a valid descriptor? Sugary, oily and slightly minty, the taste is rather one-dimensional with fresh oak spices, the expected spiritiness and a quickly fading finish. Granted, Gentleman Jack is a step up from the basic, mass-produced Jack Daniel's - but it's a small one.RATING: 2.5/5.0 stars ≙ 74 pts → SUBPAR"

Halfway down the bottle and it has subsided but just a little. It is still sweet and probably has a high rye content. Whatever the mix of the Corn, Barley and Rye it isn't good or the quality of the grain.I think this was distilled in Willy Wonka's sweet factory because it is sickly sweet. Brown sugar but one teaspoon after another. It's only redeeming feature is that it's quite smooth even with those furniture polish notes.If anyone can remember Bazooka joe you had loads of flavour at the beginning but very quickly it went quite stale and tasteless, this is the same."

Gentle indeed, Mr Gentleman ! Taste is fairly sharp - it's not sour but it almost feels like it has some acidity to it. Definately not as full bodied as other whiskey's I've had so far. Intense vaniline, as to be expected, mild oak ( light or even no charr, it seems, though I thought Jack was always pretty intensely charred ? ) Alcohol is noticable, but fairly smooth.

Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 is very young whiskey indeed. However, mixed with Coca Cola it harmonizes surprisingly well, as the late Lemmy Kilmister would have confirmed. Hence, from the perspective of a Scotch Single Malt drinker, I can recommend Jack Daniel's for mixing purposes.

Vanilla, caramel, sweet corn, maple syrup and some coconut. When the nose is pushed deep into the glass, the alcohol bites with a very slight touch of glue. More comes even after a long time in the glass definitely not, no complexity.Very sweet, almost like a liqueur! Very soft and a bit watery on the tongue. Jellybeans, vanilla cream with bananas and lots of sweet corn again. Add some ginger and nutmeg.At first, the alcohol is a bit harsh in the finish. When that has settled, it will be sweet again.

Other then that this is actually a very good dram. I really dislike the Old No'7 but this Silver Select is in a whole other ball game. It's strong and rich, not very complex but a huge flavor bomb. Might be too sweet for most but I like it every now and then. Also as this is a fact for all Tennessee whiskey's, It's non-colored.Full sweet caramel and honey. burnt sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, glue, Vanilla, caramel, glue again, hazelnuts, almonds.

4047,Jack Daniel's Silver Select,"For me, bourbon unfortunately doesn't have as much depth as other whiskey, but interesting aromas still spread when the whiskey has dried on the edge of the glass.When you first smell it, the whiskey is creamy, vanilla and sugary at the same time. Then you discover sweet banana milk made from overripe bananas, which comes out subtly. Caramel, vanilla sugar and fresh cake batter underline the sweetness. Something sweet and spicy is always in the background, maybe. young wood. When the whiskey has dried on the edge of the glass, it becomes flowery, a bit like gentle fabric softener. I also smell essential aromas and dried herbal tea.Creamy, sweet, sugary in the mouth with vanilla sugar, with light spice.The finish is spicy with young wood, vanilla stays in the mouth."
4048,Jack Daniel's Silver Select,this tenesse whiskey gets 80 points because it is well done and presented. it can't hide that it is distillied with maize/corn. So if you do not like the nose and test of the at least 51% of corn/maize do not buy this whiskey. It's a typical tennesse (bourbon) whiskey. For a bourbon/tennesse it is outstandingly good. would give more than 80 points but i do not like the bourbon taste at all...

4050,Jack Daniel's Silver Select,"Boom! Immediate impact with sweet banana surf, glue and caramel, in a super greedy pack at the beginning but which is quickly swallowed up. And also alcohol, unfortunately. Later, it calms down with a spicy profile that evokes a rye, and a side was toasted. First sip with solvated note pushed to the bottom, not tip top, the following, a little greedy, but then it burns a little in the final, what. With water, the nose changes a lot: drier, it is more gourmand on chocolate. On the palate, spicy, sweet but still with a note of alcohol dragging the leg. Full of mixed qualities and defects. It's quite confusing.  Enthusiasm 3/5"

4054,Jack Daniel's Sinatra Select,"A very good Bourbon (beat me quietly, but Tennessee Whiskey is finally just Bourbon from Tennessee ;-)), but more prestige bottling than anything else, if not the story, the booklet, the huge box and the weapons-grade bottle at least 75 € worth, you should keep away from it and rather put down a few bottles of the JB small batch series.mild, soft, sweet, toffee, vanilla, a light mushroom note, a little minty freshnessvery mild and velvety mouthfeel, but intense in taste, dark: leather, tobacco, wood, bittersweet, cocoa, oak spice - pepper and clove acutenesslong, slightly bitter, tobacco and spicy sharpness"

Big, bold and not the typical JD flavor profile, drinks easy for 65% I’d take this over many other bourbons (I am a scotch fan)Vanilla and honey toasted peanuts, banana and tobacco.Like the nose, big peanut and vanilla start, with a slight tobacco and banana mid palate. Oakiness takes the last stage along with menthol.Sweet and lingering, maple syrup joins the party and the heat keeps the banana note along til the end with a nice oaky dryness."

4074,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel  Barrel Proof,"Nose: Vanilla, caramel, oak, honeysuckle, juicy fruit gum, and a hint of banana. Oh, how could I forget, ethanol. It's quite shameless about what it is. Taste: Intense. Heavy oak. The tannins are covered up with honey, maple, caramel and strawberries. Drinks like a 110 proof. If you like committing arson on your palate like I do, look no further. Finish: Short. Charred oak and dusty corn. Worth purchasing:Depends. If you like the Jack Daniels flavor profile (even for mixing) this is the JD's crown jewel for the working man/woman. This takes a cheap common whiskey and presents it in its most unadulterated form. So share it with your loved ones. Better yet, share it with people you don't particularly care for so you can watch them gasp for air as they try to figure out if their taste buds have been seared.

If you get rid of them to some extent, you will see beautiful caramel sweet notes. Otherwise still slight fruitiness and fresh oak notes.  Taste : Here the alcohol is even more prevalent than in the smell. Otherwise also here nice caramel notes, light apple notes and fresh oak.  Reverberation : Alcoholic hot with oak notes.  Conclusion : Not very complex, but beautiful caramel and fruit tones. Unfortunately, alcoholic pungency overlays almost everything and makes this whiskey a bit exhausting"

You can hate it or love it.Very cute. Intense, vanilla, banana, caramel, oak. Not filigree, everything directly with a lot of powerNo problem at all in the mouth despite the 64.5%. Maybe a little warm and a little black pepper, the vanilla banana combo is joined by a veritable oak board that really fills the mouth with a few mint leaves and astringents.The finish is therefore rather tart of oak. Cocoa powder with vanilla and nutmeg and cloves. Unfortunately not that long."

The wort and the caramel-containing cough syrup then remain on the palate for a long time. At the end you have the feeling that a few drops of lemon juice run over a few grains of salt.

It's intense; this proves my idea that Jack is really hiding something when they mix up vats of this stuff to be watered down to 40%. Seek a bottle out if you can or trade for a sample - it'll change your mind!Wow... I've never smelled a Jack like this! Wow, first experience with a Full Proof Jack it's really worth it! Cherry cough drops, menthol, tea leaves, oak spice, fruit cake, diesel fuel, oats, and maybe even some herbal notes.... Wow, this is really active, a little overwhelming if you're expecting just regular Jack.Okay, the heat comes up here.... Buttered cherry pound cake, toasted oak, camphor, wood spices, loads of character! Sweets, loads of sweets. Cherries again; so much here, the strength is a little noticeable... but also drink at below proof. Black pepper, pastries, herbal cough medicine and touches of sweet tea (real Southern sweet tea). Wow this is very morish, but it'll come knocking at the full 132.8 Proof....Wow, here's where the legs really stretch. Loads of oak, typical Bourbon notes... but so much more.

Some smoky (charcoal) notes are there in the background.Spicy (nutmeg, pepper) attack followed by some sweetness (honey, dark fruits, caramel, toffee). Quite some spice is there from the rye but it balances well with the sweetness (but it's only 4yo ofcourse).Medium length finish, starting with some spices changing into a nice soft buttery caramel and toffee sweetness."

4113,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel - Rye,"The typical rye notes are there, although in different variety than usual, to me all aromas have a tendency towards a 'red' spectrum. It needs at least 1 tbs of water to open up, neat it feels restraint and quite uptight so to speak, along with the fact that the alcohol is not very well integrated, that diminishes once water is added.The mouthfeel is a lot lighter than your typical Jack Daniel's, in comparison it really feels thinnish, the balance of flavours is just middle of the road.Everybody that knows rye whiskey will not be disappointed, all others should sample first.Although far from being bad, I think Jack Daniel's can do a lot better than this.a bit shy and plankish at first, needs some water to properly open up, turkish delight, rosewater, cherry candy, candy sugar, pink cotton candy, some juniper, some bayleaf, some cough syrup (minty/fresh), later some cosmetic notes develop, red lipstick, there's always a coconut note lingering in the background.very mediocre arrival, then juniper, bayleaf, cherry candy, quite dry, a bit spicy, the cosmetic notes show up again, some red sherbet, the balance is ok but the body's quite thin, certainly not what I expect from a Jack Daniel's.cherry candy, oak char, coconut, red lipstick, red sherbet, a little cinnamon, still thinnish, medium to short."
4114,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel - Rye,"The flavor play is as weird as it is admirable. I would not necessarily recommend this one to a Rye newcomer.The has a lot of artificial sweetness in the nose, banana flavor, slightly perfumed, in addition to rye, distinct spice, in its contradiction almost bowmoresk without peat.Sweet but spicy, the scented floral also lingers in the mouth, slightly sour refreshing, citrus.The finish is then again Rye, banana, gummy bears, slightly zitruartige flavors, a slight acidity, pepper and oak, and a clear sweetness in petto.Am end remain tart oak notes on gummy bears."

Still has this JD Tennessee twang meaning it's distinguishable from other Ryes out there if you know the JD house style. Actually I enjoyed this one for about 85 p. but my sample I tried again a few weeks later though being screwd down tight in a small glass bottle had developed a bitter note. It seems this one does not take extended time of air exposure very well. So as long as it's fresh it's better in my experience. A fluke? I don't know.

4170,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select,"For the Jack Daniel's Single Barrel, the best barrels that have an exceptionally good degree of ripeness are selected.

This is joined by oak and some herbs.Sweet caramel and a lot of vanilla merge into spicy oak, leather and liquorice.Long-lasting and spicy, sweet. Slightly dry."

4173,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select,Actually not bad! I was expecting an absolute dram but the nose and taste do really taste like whiskey :-) Not the best quality but for its money (35€) you have nice bourbon whiskey which I did not expect like that from Jack Daniel'sSo first I do have 15-2600 but it is not listed! As I didn't expect anything the nose is quite good with a lot of vanilla and oak. With a bit of fantasy also fruity notes like apricot. Of course not a masterpiece but it could be worse.Also the taste suprises as the alcohol is carrying the nose with a very nice taste.  Ok there it is... The finish is very metallic and quite bitter wooden. 
4174,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select,"Jack Daniels Single Barrel Select. Consumed Aug 2018. Aroma is very caramel and fudge, vanilla and coconut, caramac bar, paper. Smells decent. Taste is boozy, vanilla, paper, toffeeish. Easy and not so bad. 2.9/70"
4175,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select,"Smell: Extra sweet but not to mention the level, corn syrup, maple syrup, vanilla cream, wood sticks, some light wood spices. Taste: paint, wood sticks, astringency, slightly irritating, followed by brown sugar desserts, whole grains Bread, nuts and cinnamon & pepper & ginger appeared later. Body: medium, fat, with a wrapped feeling. Final rhyme: long, dry and astringent, tamarind shell, syrup, spices Overall: 85.5/100, I haven't drunk other Jack Daniels, so it's not easy to comment, only this one is considered to be a certain degree of completion."

The alcohol is well integrated.Long and dry with oak and salt liquorice."
4180,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select  Special Edition,"This barrel select can be very finicky, if you have it too soon after opening then it could be a miss, but if you open and let it sit for a few weeks, not days, it can surprise you. This is one of the few whiskies where I had to revisit my notes after almost every tasting session. And now that my bottle after 8 months is almost empty, I think its fair to say, quirkiness aside, this whiskey is very good if not great.Banana, banana, over ripe banana. Vanilla, hardly any spiciness on the nose. Overall very mellow but intriguingly exciting.Banana from the nose becomes more sweeter and candied, caramelized toffee, ever so slight oaky chewiness but overall light & sweet very pleasant sipper.Short & sweet with toffee notes staying till the very end."

4183,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select,"Bottle R28 / 11-2156. Correct construction, very nice finish ... but alcohol a little too present.Substantially alcoholic. On wood and vanilla. A slight dilution highlights the grilled almond.Again, the alcohol is not very well integrated, it's unfortunate. On the attack, smoky wood VS fruit confit (what fruit?), Then pine spice and vanilla.Pleasant! long enough, on the pine cone, then pretty sweet / salty with a big taste of barbecue sauce."
4184,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select,"A powerful single barrel Bourbon. Full bodied with strong notes of toasted oak, caramel, vanilla and smoke. Also light spice notes.

4214,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select,"As far as I could discern, this is basically Old No. 7 bottled at 45% rather than 40%. Like ON7 the nose is greeted with vanilla, artificial banana, a light maple syrup and maybe a touch of varnish. The palate largely follows from the nose: vanilla, syrup, very light banana with the addition of the charcoal/wood to offset the sweetness. The extra 5% alcohol can clearly be felt offering a much richer and fuller mouth feel as well as some more punch (although still easily drinkable). The finish is slightly longer than ON7 but still nothing spectacular, with the sweetness fading into a light bitterness."

Indeed, I find it soft, a touch waxy and > fluffy with a perfumed detergenty hint. Bananas too. It reminds me of the first North of Scotland [grain] whiskey I ever tried, a 1973 vintage from BBR and also wheated. I must dig a sample out one day and re-review it for these pages.T: Green banana for sure. Surprisingly astringent given the softer fluffy wheated nose.F: It softens a touch by the end and stretches out down a lovely grainy-barley route.C: An absolute must-try for those convinced that standard JD is the best whiskey in the world.Scores 82 points________________________________________________________https://whiskeylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2021/03/25/odds-ends-winter-spring-2021/I’ve had this fairly recently and enjoyed it [WLP82]. This generous sample was gifted to me by SWAG member Will.N: An instant pleasure straight off, this is richer/from a fresher bottle than the one I tried in September. The nose is oily-grain/biscuity detergent-fresh with additional notes of leather, tobacco, and banana foam candy.T: A little water helps this one float. The green banana note [from before] is still utterly relevant, though less fluffy than the previous more oxidised/opened bottle.F: Think [white] ?bread? – couldn’t read my own writing – and peanut shells with a very light resinous dryness thereafter, followed by a touch of soft-astringent-fresh sweet-sour washing powder – in a good way.C: As I said before, ‘an absolute must-try for those convinced that standard JD is the best whiskey in the world’. Despite the small-batch and abv presentation, however, it’s still a tad lacking. Scores [an excellent] 81 points [the oxidised bottle marginally more favourable on the day]."

4233,Jack Daniel's Tennessee Straight Rye,"It is at least better than the Old No. 7. Unfortunately, the rye influences are hardly noticeable. If you basically like bourbon, it's quite drinkable without having to pour cola on it. Anyone looking for real rye whiskey can easily avoid it.First, typical Bourbon notes with corn, solvent, mouthwash. Add some seasoning, orange jam, vanilla.

I wonder what it could be ... yet I hope it's not that I'm actually fetishizing the thinner. 8-) (83 b) Taste: At first the taste is sweet, but then it dries out. Wood, charcoal, caramel, again thinner, but to a lesser extent than is represented in the smell.

I was expecting more from my first (and possibly last) Karuizawa, but basically it's only a 10 year old.Sweet (slightly) and creamy, fruit, flowers, herbs, wax and salt all well balancedLight and soft body, not very sweet, spicy, slightly fruity, maltyVery long finish. The empty glass after 10 minutes still tastes of sugar and bread"
4267,Karuizawa 10-year-old  Kohaku,
4268,Karuizawa 12-year-old  Ocean - Special Old,"This has nothing to do with the stellar single casks of Karuizawa bottled by Number One Drinks. This is 'ordinary' Sanraku Ocean blended malt whisky of the 1980's and 1990's in which Karuizawa was just a workhorse distillery . However, you have to read the magnificent book 'Whisky Rising' by Stefan van Eycken, to fully understand the complicated history behind this whisky.Starts quite maritime with sea air, bath-salts and beachy brine. Hints of anchovis and dried-crab-shells. Some chalk. Minty notes of pine and eucalyptus as well. Very odd.Unexpected fruity sweetness of melon, mango and pine-apple. Apricots and mandarin. Later on more on peel zest and orange-rind. Some grassiness at the background. Palter is better than the so-so nose.Medium long with leafy dryness. A little black pepper and liquorice at the end."
4269,Karuizawa 12-year-old  Ocean - Special Old,"I was more than surprised!Blind tasting:  First comes salty, maritime notes. Some gum and a flag of smoke. A waxy fruit sweetness pushes forward. Smells a bit musty and in places after chamomile tea. A light breeze of pepper brings some spice. The alcohol almost does not exist. Think here are max 43% inside.  With a little time in the glass, a slightly sour orange becomes more and more apparent. And also some leather. There is still a certain note inside, which I just can not assign.Mild, slightly watery onset. Then spice comes in the form of pepper and then a taste that just does not remind me of whiskey.  Some salty ivy-nut juice and herbs. My dear Schieber ... that's not whiskey, odda ??  The second sip comes with a certain bitterness. The tastes really medically with roasted aromas.Short to medium. Bitter, but leaves a creamy, soft, sweetened mouthfeel."
4270,Karuizawa 12-year-old  Ocean - Special Old,"This tastes like there is grain in the mix yet it is described as a blended malt?There is a metallic note to this one, like licking an sheet of aluminium (not that I do that a lot).This has perfume on the palate, it is one of those sweet and syrupy Japanese blends.Not bad but not great either but it scores a few points for being quite fat on the palate which I like."

4275,Karuizawa 12-year-old  Pure Malt Whisky,"Definitely not the best Karuizawa.  Only the final is unpleasant. The rest is still passable.

It's not very interesting and very short, something is missing.  With time opens on the caramel.Aqueous. On oak and sawdust.

4288,Karuizawa 15-year-old,"In 1956 Karuizawa was founded, unbelievably the distillery was actually a vineyard! The aim was to create premium whisky, which according to the fans fo this distillery is did. But sadly some things come to an end, and Karuizawa's fate was sealed when production was stopped in 2000.After much negotiating, the remaining stocks were bought by Number One Drinks Company. These releases are now probably more well known than those of the original owners - Mercian Wine Company. This bottles is one of those bottlings. The whisky inside this gorgeous bottle are as old as 31 years old and some as young as 15 years old. And not only that but they have also used both peated and unpeated whisky for this release. Not something you see everyday."

Very smooth and silky. Finish: Wood spice, sherry, oak. Not very long at all. Overall: A pleasant sherried dram, sweet, somewhat rich, very smooth and mellow, but with a short finish. Shows the age with some oak. Decent but definitely not a giant slayer. Again, a nice one to sample, but definitely not worth buying a bottle of this at the prices it demands these days.

It turns to more varnish and bitter wood, even as the fruit remains.Finish: Same as the palate, and a bit of a pleasant ""off"" bitter element. It's easy to drink, but unexceptional for a sherried brew (esp. for this age) and the bigger Karuizawa."

4309,Karuizawa 1960  Single Cask,"Karuizawa 1960/2012 (51.8%, Number One Drinks, sherry, cask #5627, 41 bottles)  It’s my vintage and there’s never been many 1960s around, even from Scotland. I believe it’s the oldest cask they had in Karuizawa’s warehouse. It’ll be available only in March next year, but the packaging’s already ready and it’s quite beautiful, each bottle carrying an individual antique netsuke, netsukes being these kinds of carved buttons that the ancient Japanese were using to attach their purses (kind of, well, sporrans) to their belts. No ideas about the price yet but it just cannot be cheap, can it? Colour: bronze. Nose: awe. Where to start? This is quite dry and herbal at very first (and very respectful) sniffs, with this feeling of ultra-old cough medicine or herbal liqueur, but then it’s more the pinesap that talks, together with many less aromatic inhabitants of some of the wildest forests. Right, I mean  mushrooms,  moss, fern, more pine needles, chestnut bur, leaves… It’s all very amazing and very vivid, at 52 years of age!  Fabulously complex mentholated nose… With water: pure magic. To be honest, there were a few sharper edges before, all gone! An old aviator’s leather jacket just found in the attic. Mouth (neat): this is very silly, in fact we’re almost closer to some very, very old wines off very high quality. Rivesaltes, Manzanilla, palo cortados, very old Madeira and all that jazz. The complexity is astounding, and what’s even more astounding is the fact that several fruits start to wake up after one or two minutes, including bitter oranges and figs, but the general profile becomes rather dry around the middle. Could be a very old and very earthy pre-Mao Zedong pu-erh (excuse me). With water: even more of all that, but as far as oak is concerned, I feel we’re approaching the limits. Having said that, it’s also becoming wonderfully medicinal, in ‘an oaky way’. Mint-flavoured liquorice. Finish: long, dry and herbal. Comments: I think when you’re trying such an old glory, you have to accept a little more oak, just like you won’t expect a perfect Queen Of The Night from an otherwise extremely talented 60 years old soprano.

4311,Karuizawa 1960  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"From Nonjatta:Post by Stefan Van Eycken, TokyoRecently, we had the pleasure of visiting a private collection of wines and whiskies with mostly bottlings from previous decades. The whisky collection was heavily focused on older limited editions of Japanese whiskies, which is interesting because most collections of Japanese whiskies were started post-2005 (the year the first Ichiro's Hanyu bottlings were released, and a year or two later, the first Number One Drinks releases). The collection we visited gravitated towards old and limited Suntory and Nikka items, but in a tiny corner, we discovered a hitherto unknown release that would be the crown of anyone's Japanese whisky collection: the unknown, 'other' 1960 Karuizawa single cask. And there it was sitting, as an oddity, in a dark corner.Everyone is familiar with the Number One Drinks Karuizawa 1960 (#5627), of course, but this particular bottle may be much rarer. It was bottled at the distillery. What the staff did in those days when they bottled single casks at the distillery (mostly for sale at the distillery shop) is: they would tap a cask and take as much liquid as they needed to have a good supply of a particular cask from a particular vintage on the shelves, and leave the rest to mature until a further date when they needed more. With younger vintages, bottles would sell out quite quickly (well, relatively speaking -  that would be at a snail's pace observed from today's Japanese whisky climate!). With older vintages, which were quite expensive for the time (now they'd be considered bargains, of course), that wouldn't be the case, so they would only bottle very few and they were usually on the shelves for months and years. We have no idea how many bottles were taken from cask #2435, but it's likely to be in the single digits. This particular bottle was filled on 25 July 2007 at 47yo (62.2%abv - much higher, incidentally, than the Number One Drinks 1960, which was bottled at 51.7%abv).There are many mysteries surrounding this bottle - was it bottled for a specific customer as a one-off? what happened to the remaining liquid in the cask? - and we're in the process of analysing video footage taken at Karuizawa distillery (including the shop and the shelves with all available vintages) to see if any light can be shed on the existence of this bottle. (Don't hold your breath, though!) For obvious reasons (security, first and foremost), the location of this bottle cannot be disclosed, but if it is ever opened - as we hope it will be - we'll be sure to share the news with you and throw a wicked party to mark the occasion. We're trying to encourage this, but it may never happen... In that sense, Karuizawa has become a victim of its own success, and of the madness (in terms of prices on the secondary market) surrounding it. A few years ago, setting up a tasting of that bottle would have been a walk in the park. Now, it's a different world."
4312,Karuizawa 1964,"Colour: Dark copperNose: Massive with cherries and berries, candied orange zest, hints of eucalyptus, a good whiff of a well-stocked cigar humidor, densely interwoven mild spices and a hard to describe ‘earthy freshness’.Palate: The fruitiness feels fresher than on the nose, with lime, kumquats, and hints of red currant with a minimal bitternes that is weak enough not to be disturbing, then hints of perfumed tea and those lovley spices again.Finish: Very long with fruits and spices playing together and giving way to a little smoke at the very end.Overall: This is a truly great whisky and not really what you would expect from a heavily sherried malt. Over the decades, wood spice and sherry fruit have blended into something unique here. My tasting notes just scratch the surface.http://www.dramming.com/2013/02/14/karuizawa-48-yo-1964-for-wealth-solutions-poland/"

Aged for just over 48 years in a 400-litre Sherry Oak cask, at the time of bottling, it is the oldest expression from this now closed distillery.This single malt whisky lay undisturbed in a traditional dunnage warehouse at Karuizawa before being transported to Chichibu for bottling. Being a single cask whisky, only 143 bottles are available, each individually numbered and presented in a dark wooden box fashioned in part from Polish black fossil oak.Karuizawa 1964 Cask #3603 is bottled at natural cask strength (57.7% abv), is non-chill filtered, and retains its natural colour."
4317,Karuizawa 1964,"Tasting Note by The Chaps at Master of MaltNose: Tangerines intertwine with sweet spring blossoms before yielding to freshly-dug earth, and hushed myrrh and styrax. Flowers repeat undercut and enhanced by the earthy quality - wet moss emerges from the undergrowth. Hewn trees warmed by the sun and lovely perfumes linger.Palate: Age does not deplete the force of this potent dram. Spiced orange chocolates and rich oak pervade with savoury dark sugars covering the mouth. Well-balanced throughout, it stands up well to water. Softer balance reveals itself as the alcohol is soothed by the water.Finish: Long, lingering, pleasantly drying, and gently spicy. A dram that will live in memory, not just for the rarity, but for the flavour.Overall: Capturing the essence of the Japanese value of harmony, this whisky truly provides an exceptional experience across all senses and is far-and-away extraordinary."
4318,Karuizawa 1964,",,This magnifico bottle was just launched on Feb 13 in Warsaw. Colour: rich amber. Nose: rather than smoky and chocolaty like some other old Karuizawas could be, this one is full of overripe fruits and the jams made thereof, with many spices and sappy ‘things’ in the background. In fact, it’s quite extraordinary. Strawberries with menthol? Figs and marzipan? Dates and liquorice? Quinces with some putty? There’s even something coastal that’s growing and growing, but the whole rather makes me think of some glorious very old but terrifyingly vibrant sherried Speysider that would have sucked a little extra-menthol out of a magnificent cask. And maybe a little beef stock at the same time… With water: Karuizawa really loves water, the whisky became even more fabulous and incredibly complex. Some fruitcake especially made for a very wealthy and completely mad dictator? Mouth (neat): what the hell is this? I’ve never found this is any malt whisky… Some kind of overripe tropical fruits, maybe longans? There’s also this curious cheesy side, absolutely wonderful (in this context!) New Comté or other fruity Jurassian cheese? There’s also a lot of oak, which is normal, but what’s important, I think, is that it’s all perfectly integrated. Add to that some tangerine liqueur, black pepper, cumin, cloves, grape pips (ha, resveratrol!)… All that is very big, it’s almost a monster of a whisky. With water: these wonderfully strange notes grew even bigger. Swiss cheese with mango jam. Finish: endless, with the spices singing many songs. No I won’t list them all, do not worry. Bitter chocolate in the aftertaste (tannins, but no worries). Comments: first it’s brilliant whisky, and second, it’s ‘different’ whisky. Respect. I’m sorry, but that’ll be SGP:571 - 95 points."" - Serge Valentin, Whiskyfun.comhttp://www.whiskyfun.com/archivefebruary13-1.html#140213"
4319,Karuizawa 1965  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,I wonder why these two individuals have rated this bottle so low...i wonder if its because they want to keep the other bottling of this same cask at higher ratings...Do you fellows want to put some actual notes to your sub-40 point ratings??

4321,Karuizawa 1965  Single Cask,Close to perfection!
4322,Karuizawa 1965  Single Cask,"Do you really need the price? It’s more or less the price of a Toyota Aygo. Yes that’s a car. Colour: amber. Nose: less closed than when I first tried it with Dave. We had thought it was ‘the slowest whisky in the East’! Navigates around marzipan-filled and ham-rolled prunes, camphory pipe tobacco, sultanas, sandalwood, some very sappy pinewood, and oriental pastries, baklava, orange blossom water, pistachio nougat… I have to say I’m finding this nose quite sublime. Here we go again! With water:  it doesn’t change much, but it was already quite perfect when unreduced. Mentholy raisins, date eau-de-vie, dried pears… Mouth (neat): starts a bit on damson plums, zwetschke pudding, propolis, black raisins, more prunes… It’s not easy to detect an ex-bourbon cask, this could as well have been a sherry cask if you ask me. Very mentholy background, with all oils and molecules ending with –ol, and something empyreumatic, as they say in wine when they want (hope) to sound smart. With water: water brings out the tannicity, as always, and makes the whole much drier, but we remain below the limits, which is a little miraculous. Assam tea, bitter liquorice… Finish: very long, and here come our friends the citrus fruits, which really ‘lift it’. Astonishingly fresh, with some kumquats, and more liquorice in the aftertaste. Comments: pretty exceptional, as expected. The sherried Karuizawas are maybe a little more renowned, but this bourbon is truly great, you just need to give time and to let it breathe. As far as the Toyota Aygo’s concerned, that’s without any options I’m afraid. And with the smallest engine. SGP:661 - 94 points.Whiskyfun.com"

4324,Karuizawa 1967  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"04/21/2020: It is with a little emotion that I write this note. It took me 8 years of Karuizawa hunting to finally get my hands on it. The color is simply divine, the liquid too. Breathtaking complexity. 09/09/2021: Still fantastic. The nose gains one point with aeration, but may remain a bit below that of the 68. The balance is stunning, especially in the mouth.What power on the nose. We're on a very, very big Sherry. It is above all the precious wood that stands out, with a nice dose of wax. Then we let ourselves be enchanted by the oily leather, also waxed. A beautiful pair of new shoes that are taken out of their box. Dried fruits then take over. Figs, dates, almonds, pecans. A little Kirsch, plum and a hint of blackcurrant. That continues on the redcurrant and cherry jam. Then we go back to the hospital, with a nice dose of camphor and ground black pepper. Chocolate appears as if by magic. Very black, very bitter. Then it evolves on coffee beans and gingerbread. A very light damp earth finishes this nose. However much more discreet on other Karuizawa. This nose is a whole story unfolding. That of 42 years in a magnificent cask. With water: star anise and light smoke.If the nose was powerful, the mouth returns the favor. What a delight. The jammy fruits are there. Cherry, plum, blackcurrant, currant. Precious wood wraps all these fruits. It is old, waxed, dusty. You can smell the resin of the wood. We bite into a bar of dark chocolate, we breathe our bag of coffee. We bite into a stick of liquorice. We still have this medicinal side, this camphor. Black pepper. We also have the bitterness of Pu Ehr Shu which comes to mingle with that of wood. A little cough syrup. An old pipe, an old cigar, a nook in the woods. Then to finish a little molasses, freshly laid macadam, motor oil. An old workbench left abandoned. Breathtaking complexity. With water: a little smoke, barbecue.Long, delicious finish. Everything is here. Camphor, liquorice, dried and red fruits, leather in abundance. We do not forget the pepper, aromatic herbs, tobacco, cigars. And obviously the wood, in all its nobility, in all its length. It is interminable."

The palate is fresh but a little bit disappointing due to sudden changes into oakness. （maybe the expectation was too high) Nonetheless legendary!Oh, very dense and classic old sherry, violet flowers, black currents, underneath there is noticeable oiliness, such as pine oil, or petrol, some high esters are there. All those oily olives, long-aged ham, and nuts! The integration is perfect and there are no off-notes at all. Head to head to another sherry monster Black Bowmore 2nd edition: This one is clearly richer and more fruity, with a lot of high-end leather, iodine and honey ham, countless flavors! Dark chocolates are the backbone, with prominent spices such as star anise and cinnamon. The thickness of the nose is just seductive and endless.Very powerful and salty introduction, then it becomes a heaven of sherry flavors: dark fruits, raisins. The fruity side turns very quickly to a minty chocolaty side, a little bitter but overall very refreshing. Those old sherry monster are never tiring. Finally, the dark chocolate flavors dominate.Medium-Long, dark chocolates with tons of spices. Then a lot of amazing flavors from the sea, toasted seaweeds and oysters. Violet flowers."

Good stuff more bubblegum notes this time.  Longrow sa - What a nose this has, one of the best, awesome overall, cannot fault this in any way, perfect but my palate has been smashed by this one.   Will need a break for the Glenlivet  so far NOSE   1 - Glenfiddich  2 - Longrow  3 - Tormore  4 - KaruizawaPALATE  1 - Longrow  2 - Tormore  2 - Glenfiddich (equal)  4 - Karuizawa  At the moment the Glenfiddich and Karuizawa are dropping a point as does the Tormore but the Longrow goes up a point., saying that the nose on the Glenfiddich is at 99p  so where does this Glenlivet fit in?  OMG, yes it is still 97p verging on 98, cannot decide but it is a work of art, you know what  I cannot really split the Glenlivet and the longrow but I will give the Glenlivet the nod by a whisker.  Holy Cow, what a surprise.  Edit  after much deliberation I left the KZ at 95 and the Glenfiddich at 96 as the nose on this is the best out of anyhing I can remember, its a 98 nose at least maybe 99 on sweet coffee.  The Tormore drops a point almost 2 but its only a single point in front of the KZ. The Longrow goes up a point and well deserved and the Glenlivet stays on top at 98, for now anyway, next week I might think differently remember this H2H is just a snapshot in time."
4339,Karuizawa 1967  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"I will now compare this to the Glenfarclas 40 year 105 that I scored at 95 points, whisky like this requires stiff competition to accurately gauge its qualities.H2H with this GFhttps://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/9470/glenfarclas-105 The nose of the Glenfarclas is more delicate than the KZ and it is more vibrant also but I actually notice a slight bitterness this time that I never noticed before.The bitterness soon goes on the GF with some peat creeping in but its basically more fireworks on the palate but on the whole the Karuizawa has more body and a little more depth of profile.I think the KZ wins this scrap by a whisker so I will revers my original scores meaning 94p for the GF and 95 for the KZ."

4344,Karuizawa 1968  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"04/21/2020: Tasted in f2f with the 1967 # 6426. Hard to decide between them. The 1967 was more about raw horsepower and its palate is downright unbeatable. Here the nose is a bit richer. In both cases, killings. Monsters of complexity. I don't see what can be done much better in sherry. 95-95-95 09/09/2021: Always a killer. The additional aeration may have melted the aromas a little more. There is also a very nice exoticism which is revealed, with passion fruit and mango. On the nose, but also in the mouth and especially in retro-olfaction. Tasted after 1969 # 8183 and 1972 # 7290, we are really a step above in terms of balance, complexity, personality. 96-95-95What wealth. We have 3% more alcohol than the 1967 here and yet it seems sweeter. Superb waxed noble wood. Candle. Dried fruits and red fruits. Pecans, blackcurrants, plums, cherries, toasted almonds, figs, prunes. But also a little citrus, lemon, orange. Cristalized sugar. Very greasy quality leather. Undergrowth, rain. Medicinal, camphor, eucalyptus. Walnut oil, sesame. Anise. Very light oil lamp, dust. After aeration we have cold tobacco and a light peat. Just like the 1967, the complexity is absolutely monstrous. You are overwhelmed by so many aromas and peeling them is almost mentally exhausting. With water: even more medicinal.In the mouth it is also an explosion of flavor. Oily leather, wax, precious wood, cedar, dust, underwood, licorice. What a mixture of aroma! Figs, dates, currants, nuts, caramel, toffee. Blackberry jam, plum, blackcurrant. Always a little medicinal, eucalyptus, camphor. Pepper. Barbecue, grilled meat, cannon powder, light peat. With water: plum, hardwood, wax, dust, cinnamon.Long finish on the undergrowth, rain, hummus, tobacco, cigar, cinnamon and cocoa. A delight. Endless. Light peat and smoke remaining."

4379,Karuizawa 1970  Geisha Label,I think the palate is more interesting than the nose. A rare thing for a whisky of this age.  The oak is dominant  in this but not excesively so. I am coming to find that on average I appreciate 80s Karuizawas more so than older bottles from the 70s.
4380,Karuizawa 1970  Geisha Label,high quality and meticulous sherry wood aroma.very great!
4381,Karuizawa 1970  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Very much like an old cognac. It presents a strong fruit profile on plums, cherry, and stewed oranges. There's strong oak in the form of menthol and a clear bitterness. Underneath all this is a certain umami quality like melted brown butter with a touch of sugar. This might have been fantastic 10-15 years younger, but as is, you can get the same profile for much less with cognac. The other, younger Karuizawa I have tried was substantially more interesting."
4382,Karuizawa 1970  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Brilliant karuizawa, the precious wood notes are amazing, very fruity, rancio, orange, sweet spices, that must have been an exceptional cask"
4383,Karuizawa 1970  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Still a very good Karuizawa. Without Sherry's influence, it lacks for me some undergrowth aromas characteristic of the distillery. But we still have a very nice fruit salad. Alcohol is extremely well integrated. Beautiful glass.Sublime nose that shocks by its delicacy. One is indeed on a Bourbon cask here, and for once, I believe the label.  Gunpowder, precious wood, wax, solvent, paint. Cherry, brandy, plum, rancio, papaya, peach, strawberry.  Surprisingly very fruity.  Chocolate, cocoa powder, camphor.  The more the whisky comes, the more exotic comes out.In the mouth it's sublime. Many red fruits, rancio, wood, cognac.  Strawberry, cherry, plum, dry reasons. Hazelnut.  Chocolate, varnished wood.  It's very balanced and balanced.Long finish on the fruit, the solvent, the waxed wood."
4384,Karuizawa 1970  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"One of the rarest and oldest ex bourbon single cask from this famous distillery.I think the oldest ex bourbon single cask from Karuizawa was distilled in 1969 and bottled in 2012 at an age of 42 years (cask #8183, exclusively for LMDW)."
4385,Karuizawa 1971  Noh Whisky,"A very concentrated juice, with some nice fruity aromas on the nose. Especially love the pipe tobacco flavours on the palate, textbook 70's Karuizawa. As usual, tasting may vary, but that's also why Karuizawa is very ""fun"" too."

Colour: amber – bronze.                                             Nose: very hot and more on gentian                                             eau-de-vie and very ‘ripe, dry                                             figs’ (not rotting but quite).

4391,Karuizawa 1971  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Certainly a nose cleaner. Water is compulsory to tame its vibrant character and appreciate its richnessVerytangy. Nutty. Rich. Dry almonds, raisins. Opens on luscious Dundee cake notes. But the alcohol is aggressive. A touch of old leather. With water,damson plumsThe alcohol bite is too strong to enjoy the smooth “would be”feel. Oily. Water brings out ripe fruit notes.And a lovely spicy festoonToffeish,gently spicy"
4392,Karuizawa 1971  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"This one was expensive but worth every penny. Adding water calms down the explosion of taste a bit but is not really needed as 64% ABV not is noticeable as you would expect. An absolutely spectacular whisky.  Wow, what an impressive nose. Sherry is massive with Raisins, dates, figs. there are also oak vanilla, rubber, bitumen, amaretto and some more that I have a difficulty to put a name on.Enters sweet and then an explosion on different tastes. Sherry and the dark fruits from the nose comes as a tide wave, then soft spices oak, rubber, vanilla and tropical fruits. Absolutely wonderfulLong and tasty finish with almost all of the tastes remaining all the way out"
4393,Karuizawa 1971  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,very good dram
4394,Karuizawa 1971  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"This dram has grown old, but in the most graceful way imaginable.  The palate and finish don't really reach the heights of the nose, but how could they?  Stuff like this makes a nonsense of points scales that give equal marks to different elements.  Really if 90+ points makes a whisky worth trying then the nose on this is 95.  But that's not the whole story; the palate and finish are fine too.  They are just overshadowed by the opening.  One of the most impressive things about this is the way that its handled the wood for 37 years.  The whisky gives you things you would expect to find in an old dram without the intense wood spice.  Its a thing of beauty and I'll always remember it.  I have a little left in the sample bottle and I'll keep it for a wee while.  I'd like to try this again after a gap.Oh God!  This is one of the reasons why people would leave whisky in a cask for a ridiculously long time.  Its all dark stewed fruits (prunes and mince pie filling) and sweet, burning apple wood.  There are some things reminiscent of an old Ardbeg I had a wee while ago, (I think it was cask 1375), but there are serious differences too.  This is much meatier, like an elderly peated Mortlach.  Heaps of dried fruits delivered swiftly to your nostrils by the strength of this dram.  There's leather there too.  Old leather that hasn't been used for a while.  Some linseed oil.  And yet if you trap the vapour for a while the very first hit gives some floral elements.  What a fantastic nose.  I get the feeling that if you sat with it long enough it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.  This has to be one of the best things I've ever nosed.  If I was Jim Murray I might give it twenty four and seven eighths out of twenty five.  Since its me I'll give it 25.Old leather and furniture polish, but its holding it tightly.  I think it may need just a droplet of water to open up.  Trouble is I'm scared to try.  Here goes: Ah that cracks it.  Just a tiny drop releases the flavours.  Again I'm reminded of Mortlach at its best; a rich, full bodied meatiness.  Mmm ...The finish is lovely.  Its medium length rather than long, but it gives you the sensations of drying woodspice in a very gentle and charming way."
4395,Karuizawa 1971  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Definitely one of the best whiskies I have ever had. Highly recommended, if you ever get a chance to taste it."
4396,Karuizawa 1971  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"For me a candidate for the best whisky in the world.Oh so lovely! Intensive aromatic sherry sweetness. Also reminding of mixed fruit jam (strawberry, raspberry, apricot jam, plum butter, figs and sultanas). Nougat, toffee, tirasmisu, leather. Very very complex and perfectly balanced.Powerful, extremely rich and oily. More or less the aromas from the nose are repeated on the palate. The sweetness is overwhelming reminding of the finest pralines ever made. Also reminding of a 1971 Port Wine of high end quality. Delicate wood, dark, exotic but always decent. I can not imagine any whisky tasting better.A never ending pleasure."
4397,Karuizawa 1971  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"At first contact you´ll be attacked with strongly sweet sherry mixed half to half with wood varnish giving the whisky the perfect balance. Additionally, hints of glue, sweet chocolate, prunes, menthols, cherries, hints of leather, mint, some smoke, roots, honey, as well as candied oranges. It´s perfectly balanced.It starts extremely sweet with cream to is, then it becomes a little sour with hints of citrus and sweet red oranges. This doesn´t long forever, here come roots, white pepper and hot chili. It´s very warming! Additionally, hints of prunes, hair spray, cherries in chocolate and spirit, as well as hints of tobacco.Very long starting somewhere between sweetness and dryness, then filled with dried fruits, pepper and jalapeno. What a great whisky, well balanced and very complex."

In addition there are nut and cereal flavors, brittle, caramel, a few fruity flavors and a stronger salty spice. Slightly smoky underlaid and actually, relatively untypical compared to the darker karu's. Soft lime juice and wet cardboard come in addition to it.  Taste:  Wow ... full, fat, spicy and very peppery with chilli, orange pepper and china grass. Sweet, more and more assertive honey character. Oak wood. Herbs and here too little fruit. However, packed together, it results in a very ingenious combination and taste - TOP!  Finish:  Long - sweet and still powerful.

4426,Karuizawa 1973  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Karuizawa 1973/2013 (67.7%, Number One Drinks, sherry oak, cask #1607, 138 bottles) This baby is the ueber-winner of the Malt Maniacs Awards 2013. Colour: dark amber. Nose: exactly what I had expected, the Karuizawa is spicier and more on polished wood than the Glendronach, more on coffee as well, while some rather similar whiffs of old cough syrup start to arise after just five seconds. More tobacco , cedar wood and incense as well, we're well at Karuizawa and just like in the Glendronach, the sherry does not dominate too much. Brilliant.  With water: very lovely putty-like scents, almond oil, sandalwood, amarena... At this stage it's absolutely impossible for me to tell you which one I like best, both are stunning. And this one makes me think more and more of a super old Demerara rum. Mouth (neat): it's very strong but the syrupiness makes it kind of quaffable provided you don't take more than a quarter of a drop at a time. A feeling of polished woods again, menthol cigarettes, ultra-dark 90% chocolate, crunching coffee beans... With water: yesss! Water can make these old ones a tad too woody but that's not what's happening here, not at all. It's an avalanche of kumquats, spices of herbs that hints at high-end mulled wine. Especially cinnamon, cloves and dried orange zests are very obvious. Finish: very long, on menthol, dark chocolate and coffee, but it never, ever gets drying. Comments: as exceptional as expected. My compadres from the current Malt Maniacs Awards jury sure have good tastes. And once again, Merry Christmas! SGP:562 - 93 points."

4430,Karuizawa 1975  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"[January, 2019] It is a new year so I try another Karuizawa - in the meantime even samples are priced completely out of this (whisky) world......and to be honest: This is a fine old-school sherried malt that is both interesting to explore and enjoyable to sip - but it is hopelessly over-hyped and over-priced! For one bottle of this Karuizawa you can buy ten bottles of the Glenfarclas Family Cask 1986/2018 (WB id 117025) that offers almost exactly the same profile and drinking experience (and I liked it even a little better). Leave this expensive stuff for collectors and investors...The colour is tawny and the nose offers a delicate and bold old-school sherry profile that reminds me a lot of the finest Glenfarclas Family Casks I tried over the last months. Perfect old style sherry with all the beautiful aromas that only a cask coopered in the seventies (or earlier) could deliver. Not sure if there are any notes of the Karuizawa malt survived under all the sherry flavours - but who cares if the sherry is that beautiful?The taste is truly multi-layered like almost all old-school sherried drams with mainly sherry-induced flavours and spicy wooden notes. In a later wave a delicious fruitiness pops up before the nuts join in to create a wonderful nutty chocolatey flavour. Some water releases more aromas in the nose and turns both taste and finish smoother and more fruity. But to be honest: I like the neat dram better because it offers the old-school sherry profile on full throttle...The dram arrives warming and instantly coating on the palate with no distracting moments. The finish is very long and adds more spices (green peppers) before it gets even more chocolatey towards the end. No distracting bitter or drying moments, this cask was bottled at the right time."

4435,Karuizawa 1975  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"What's there to say except for that this is absolutely awesome? Nothing.An abundance of old sherry. Furniture polish, leather, dry tobacco and burlap. Some dried plums, aged balsamic and cherry syrup mixed with old oak and sandalwood. A very subtle hint of wood smoke.Pretty much every aroma returns. Pretty powerful, but perfectly drinkable without water. Balsamic, plums and cherry syrup make an encore. Pepper and cinnamon are here. As well as old wood and aniseed.Long with lots of spices and dried red fruit."
4436,Karuizawa 1975  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"A nice Karui (again). Can be a little extreme and dense. It requires the addition of a littleVery dense but closed enough. Sherry is present, especially on dried fruits: plums, figs and apricots especially. Also some citrus (rather on orange and mandarin). But it is beautiful is a Karui and wood is relatively present without, as usual, either disturbing or too much. With water, a lot of wax, the fruity is even more marked (plums) and it is probably better balanced and fresher: menthol, licorice.Here again it is concentrated and powerful: woody, creamy, fruity and meaty aromas (smoked meat). A little extreme anyway and probably requires some water. The addition of water does him good and frees him. The old bake comes out a lot, the spices too. These are numerous and rather melted.

4443,Karuizawa 1976  Noh Whisky - Kamiasobi - Hagoromo,"Well, one word here: complexity.  It is not the most balanced, it requires a lot of ventilation, a lot of time and concentration.  But the reward is there. A very complex sherry and built around a decidedly camphorized base.  I would have liked a touch of undergrowth more present, especially on the nose, but it is at least there in the final.  Superb.  Leave him an hour in the glass.  And no worries, the 63% do not feel at all.  92 or 93/100A nose of remarkable freshness for 63%  It's clearly camphor, eucalyptus, fresh mint that come to me first.  Then the sherry aromas take over. Large fat leather, dried fruits (nuts, hazelnut, nutmeg), plums, figs.  A little dark chocolate. A lot of wood. Varnish, solvent.  Quite a few fresh fruits except a little currant and some berries.  After a start of aeration, the balance is still not quite there. The freshness and the leather stands well ahead of the rest. We also have liquorice that appears. A little sage. Light coal.  Then after 45 minutes the magic works.  The camphor fruit appears, finally. Magnificent.  Plum, pineapple, tangerine. Clove.In the mouth we are on the archetype of big sherry.  A lot of leather, cream of wax, wood, licorice.  Fruit cooked and cooked again. Red, kiss, currants, strawberries, blackberries.  Cinnamon, cocoa powder. Cherry brandy.Super finale on the ground, the undergrowth, the mushroom, the big sherry.  Always leather, wood, wax, liquorice.  Cocoa powder, chocolate. Nutmeg, pepper, hazelnut.  Of an impressive complexity."
4444,Karuizawa 1976  Noh Whisky - Kamiasobi - Hagoromo,"Dark amber. Nose is heavily sherried (of course), rich and well integrated with forest mushroom, rich beef stock, fig compote. Mouth is equally rich yet bright and wonderfully integrated. Orange liqueur, mushroom, dense fig/date jam, sweet rich cakes. With water, it becomes sweeter and more about candied lighter fruits. Drinking this next to an Ardbeg 1967 cask 574. I like this more on the nose as it's tighter and more refined, but the Ardbeg is bigger and more all-encompassing in the mouth. This is more about the mushroom wood, and it's super tight and focused despite being this old and strong.  "

Black tea. Blackcurrant juice. Blueberries. Earthy forest, full of mist, cool air, and a hint of mint. Mushrooms! The good kind! Seriously, this is a very nice beginning to a tasting!Certainly high strength, but actually rather balanced, to be honest, for something that is 61% in ABV. Oh, this is so typical Karuizawa.. with an elegant sherried profile combined with a certain dirtiness, less so dirty here than some others. Again, lots of mushrooms.Terrific stuff.

Nose: once again we’re within the same style as with the 1982 and 1981, although this one seems to be a tad more polished and a little less sherried. Very obvious notes of tangerine liqueur (Madarine Impériale). It seems that this is great but at 63% abv, let’s not take chances by nosing it too deeply… With water: high viscimetric index! ;-). Right, right, this one is the closest to the greatest Scotches within the bunch, and I can’t help thinking of a great old HP. Mouth (neat): once again, we’re in the same territories, although this seems to a little more on the oaky side… Or maybe not, hard to say at 63%. Burns your throat as soon as you ingest more than half a drop. With water: exceptional, just exceptional. Time to call the anti-maltoporn brigade if you please… Finish: wow.Comments: no whisky, pure sin – and big cojones.

4464,Karuizawa 1977  Noh Whisky - Kamiasobi -  Ama the Fisher-girl,"It's all simply superb.  The first time I tasted it a few years ago in the same bottle I was disappointed, surprised by an excessively animal side. This time it seems much more classic Karuizawa but very successful. An example of balance. It lacks just a small dose of black fruit on the nose and an earthy side to be even better in my opinion.  We can not say it enough, a Karuizawa improves in bottle.Superb nose quite typical Karuizawa.  We have the perfect triangulation between leather, precious wood and camphor.  A slightly animal side attenuated by the nobility of the distillate.  The degree of alcohol is not overly felt despite almost 63%  Camphor is gaining more and more space with aeration.In the mouth we start with camphorated fruit.  It's red. Dirty but settles with the opening.  Winey. Old cognac.Long final, superb. On the black fruit, red. Precious wood."

Nose: what strikes me first is this unusual combination of metallic and meaty notes with wheelbarrows of gunpowder and peppercorn. Truly peculiar, especially since it develops on even more grilled meat and ham as well as… exhaust pipes? Sounds weird but it isn’t, it’s all very beautiful. With water: oooh yes! Water makes wonders, it became fantastic, roasted, chocolaty, herbal, sappy, minty, camphory, mushroomy (not musty)… In short, wonderful. If you don’t add water to this kind of whisky you’ll just miss 80% of the aromas. Mouth (neat): hot and fruity. A bit difficult for that matter, you do not want to anaesthetize your palate before diner, do you? With water: it’s definitely rich, not exactly fruity in fact, rather kind of resinous and slightly leathery. The oak becomes louder as well, with spices starting to appear to the surface. Cloves, pepper, even mustard (not wasabi!) Finish: very long, peppery, dry, maybe just a tad drying but nothing serious, it’s even something that sort of cleans your palate.

The addition of water brings out the smoke and the hints of old leather.Alcohol is also controlled in the mouth.  A woody present but not excessive despite its age, brings a nice structure in the mouth.  Sherry is more present than the nose with oranges, chocolate and vinous notes.

Let’s give it time… zzz… Well, nothing beats time with anything related to whisky, even a few minutes in the glass. Gone the solventy notes, hello fudge, marmalade, butterscotch, rancio (touches) and not-too-sweet raisins. Pretty often, these old ex-bourbon Karuizawas do display sherried notes, which is funny. With water: cough syrup, just like in the 1979, but this time the whole got even more medicinal. Some kind of secret concoction that would cure just anything! The croissants are back as well. Mouth (neat): as creamy as honey, rather spicy, marmalady and rather tannic. Ginger, cinnamon mints, cumin, strong tea…But once again, the citrusy side saves it. Even better, that comes with perfect earthy tones. With water: almost the same whisky as the 1979, with just a few more medicinal and kind of spiky touches. Peppermint?

What is a bourbon cask ??? Unbelievable ! On the palate, the misunderstanding is total also because behind the intensity, we have red berries in whole baskets: cherries, raspberries ... With a little water, the fruits are less supported, leaving room for malt and a some sweetness. It was my first Karuizawa, so in itself, it was already a great moment. That said, I would never have guessed blindly that this drink was 35 years old. The strength of the alcohol, even reduced to water prevented any impression of maturity to settle. Not that it is too young, of course! The ultra-fruity side was very nice, but I will be a little provocative saying that if Uberach out a Banyuls cask around 60%, it will have the same intensity on the red fruit.  Enthusiasm 4/5"
4492,Karuizawa 1978  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"It's great. Freshness and wealth. Another very good KaruiAmazingly cool for her age! A delicate woody, strawberry jam simmering in the pot. It's rich, creamy but it's pretty hard to describe. Notes of earth and black tea appear quickly. The 63% is surely a joke because never alcohol is felt. Citrus fruits are also present but secondary.Here too it is rich and dense. There is a real mache without it being heavy at all. The wood is more marked than the nose, and there is a little astringency. There are very ripe fruits, almost macerated, eucalyptus, noble wood, blond tobacco, glue and varnish, coconut, ... Very complex. After a few sips, the wood is much less felt.On a nice smoke, ashes of wood and a hint of vanilla. Superb but a bit too short."

But I feel that with more ventilation ... we are not far from the killing.A winey nose full of rancio.  A hint of sulfur. Rubber. Damn.  A hint of smoke.  We have cocoa, dark chocolate, coffee.  Nuts and nuts.  Dried fruits: figs, dates, apricots. Blackberries.  A little pepper. Dust.  At the opening the rubber disappears to give way to a light medicinal veil.In the mouth we find unfortunately this little touch of rubber and sulfur.

This time it's fudge, chocolate, melons and melissa. And maybe that verbena as well. I love verbena, one can find some old bottles of 'Verveine du Velay' pretty easily and for cheap, I think they're always worth your hard-earned euros or bucks. With water: same, it's rather more chocolaty and pretty drier than the 1981. Maybe a little metallic too, but it's lovely. Mouth (neat): thicker, more honeyed than the 1981, spicier and mintier as well. A lot of camphor, cough syrup, bitter oranges, touches of Spanish ham, probably some cranberry juice, even guava juice... Another one that's pretty perfect. With water: indeed. More menthol, more liquorice, maybe more wood extracts? Finish: very long and quite terpenic. I love this just a little less than the 1981's utterly perfect balance. Comments: another masterpiece.

The peat is almost stripping the feeling from your tongue, it is not a power thing but more the taste that does it.It settles down on mocha, coffee beans and a slight brown vinegar note and does improve with time but like the Hanyu I have just tasted it is all front loaded as a taste experience after the initial blast of flavours there is little else to speak of.,There is a nice stewed plum note, (Damson) but there is a sulphur not that stops it, not bad enough to stop the taste but its there.short on flavout but the throat feels warm for a long time, mouth drying, not the best of finished.This certainly does not leave you wanting more."

Needs a lot of time time to develop and for nosing. A lovely nose.Lovely, sweet and fruity with notes of sandalwood as long as the whisky is still in the mouth. A lot of sulphur - like chewing matchsticks - when swallowed. I never had a whisky that tasted so much like sulphur before, and I have tasted more than 2000 different ones so far.

4516,Karuizawa 1980  The Golden Samurai,"Karuizawa 1980/2015 (61.6%, OB, The Whisky Show) Four stars Picture of a mock-up bottle. It does look a bit ‘Kim Jong-il’, doesn’t it. Colour: mahogany. Nose: never has any whisky been this close to an old cognac at cask strength. Raisins, peaches, rancio. And then, rather a mineral/medicinal development, with some tiger balm, bandages, and antiseptic (touches). Which you can find in old cognac too. We all know that old spirits converge, don’t we. With water: Vicks Vaporub! Not the first time we’re finding this in Karuizawa. That means menthol and eucalyptus galore, plus lemongrass. Mouth (neat): starts clean, on oranges and flints, and gets then more mineral/medicinal again. Drinking mercurochrome and liquid clay. That’s meant to be good for your stomach, mind you. I mean, liquid clay, not whisky at 61.6% vol.! Numbs your lips a bit. With water: becomes very mentholy. Crème de menthe, salted liquorice, menthol snuff… You need to be acquainted with this style. The problem might be that it does not swim too well, while it’s really too hot when undiluted. Or maybe buy an electronic pipette? Finish: very long, salty and mentholy, really extreme. Drinking a blend of seawater and mint eau-de-vie. Or perhaps overcooked manzanilla. Comments: love it because it’s so extreme. Extreme whiskies are any taster’s joys, because they’re anything but boring. On the other hand, as far as organoleptical science is concerned, this is almost pure heresy. You’ll find in this one any compound that ends with –ol. SGP:373 - 85 points.whiskyfun.com"

Huge amounts of chocolate there too and peanuts for sure. Theres a quiet but clear, spirity chemical note thats turning more hammy as it opens up, [a little Lowlands shape there?].

Sweet porridge with cinnamon, cream and honey. Molasses and sugarcane are the dominating aromas. I love it.Ouch! Powerful, hot and bold. The 63% do their work.

Then, change of scenery, black grapes, blackberries and blueberries highlight the quality and complexity of its fruitiness. Palate: fine, racy. It redoubles elegance, the grapes, become dry, alongside blood oranges. The mouth is covered by a carpet of mousse covered with noble spices (cardamom, coriander, cloves). Saline, it shines by the invigorating and salivating qualities of its bitters. Final: tasty, delicate. The black fruits became bright red (wild strawberry, currant). Chocolate and hazelnut go hand in hand with figs and fresh dates. Floral (peony, linden) and herbaceous notes bring us back to the early days of summer. Later liquorice and pipe tobacco emanate from the empty glass."

In the straight line of the nose, complex, with beautiful tobacco notes, plum, cherries with alcohol, dark chocolate, precious wood, a little rubber, some spices (ginger?), And a earthy peat and smoke of the most beautiful effect. Alcohol is very well integrated.Long, endless, on sherry, wood, but without astringency."

4548,Karuizawa 1981  Geisha Label,"Amazing, delicious, bright, strong.The noble tones of Oloroso: leather, tobacco leaf, a little varnish and watercolors. Fresh grape leaf, tea rose. Very dry flavors. With the addition of water, the flavors become as sweet as dark plum jam.The taste is very bright, explosive, dry, rich, sweet, full of prunes and dark grapes. With water, of course, it is sweeter and less scalding.The aftertaste binds the tongue with a net, sweet, long and very bright. You involuntarily chew your tongue to release the receptors."
4549,Karuizawa 1981  Geisha Label,"N: Its almost a stout colourwise. On the snifter im getting bluetac, cherrys, clay, flint and gunpowder, rubber and new leather belts. Interesting stuff but nothing in comparison to the 1970 sherried vintage WB which effortlessly offers Wham-bar/Fruitella and marmalade coulis in abundance without the weird bluetac vibe.T: Super intense with a concentrated thickness that comprises of a marmalade-prune-putty mouthful and a larger than life delivery, helped by the abv. With water it becomes too murky and like tar although theres more toffee. Not a great deal here either way.F: Medium dry, muddy and ‘sheepish’ finish with used tobacco butts and stale cigarette ash that hangs around.C: Excellent upfront but thereafter we all found this vintage to be non directional and rather uninspiring [by Karuizawa standards], which just goes to show that its not all plain sailing.Scores a B"

4551,Karuizawa 1981  Geisha Label,"From Nonjatta: http://nonjatta.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/Karuizawa-TWE.htmlThis is a totally different beast. Extreme and definitely not for the vegetarians among us. The colour itself is unlike anything I’ve seen before… deep kakhi brown. The nose is intense, up there with the most extreme Karuizawas we know: earthy (a forest in fall) with old chapel notes, stewed prunes, blueberry jam, barbecued spare-ribs, balsamic glaze, smoked horsemeat, oven roasted burdock, mimolette cheese and much more… On the palate, you get more grilled meat, mole sauce, smoked duck and figs, seville orange marmalade, duck à l’ orange (I know, more duck!), smoked macadamia nuts and sudachi (that lovely old Karuizawa signature note!). Towards the end, a sharp bitterness emerges (think goya), leading into the finish, where it merges with dark chocolate mousse, smoked bacon and dates."

It begins on an umami, maderized quality and orange, then it goes briefly tart, before presenting an incense-like spice, chocolate, and finally a long but mild natural vanilla note with lingering incense. Despite its age, I do not find it particularly bitter from the oak, nor are there peppermint / menthol notes that I often dislike.

If only I could go back in time.The nose is of an absolutely fantastic intensity.  We feel the balance brought by 33 years in cask, the aromatic power of a great sherry.  We start in a woody register. Quite characteristic of (good) Karuizawa, we are on freshly cut cedar.  Then a good balance brought by earthy notes, tobacco, humus, powder. Some aromatic herbs.  The fruit is also present even though more withdrawn. Rather in the form of blackberry jam and currant.  With time, we have some camphor notes.The earth wakes up, and take the front. Dry mushrooms, tobacco smoke. A little meaty side.  The fruits are always present, and to those of the nose are added some touches of cassis and strawberry.  The wood is perfectly melted and is more discreet.Long and delicious, almost honeyed.  The aromas are in the continuity of the mouth, with the return of the medicinal notes of the nose and always a small note of smoke.  It's long, it warms, it soothes."

Who still opens them now?This Karuizawa 1981 cask #152 was part of the 2014 collection from La Maison du Whisky, which included four Karuizawas from the late 1970s and 1981.Karuizawa 1981 cask #152 LMdWKaruizawa 33 yo 1981 (54,5%, OB for LMdW 2014, sherry cask #152, 566 btl.)Nose: the nicest humidors, with lots of tobacco notes (cigars but pipes even more) and exotic woods like cedar and thuja. Big fruity notes too, strawberry jams and blackberries. Thyme, dried porcini. Some hickory smoke after a while. Pu-erh tea. Old roses, hints of lokum even. We tried this alongside the Karuizawa Nepal Appeal and I prefer this nose. Mouth: not as bloated as some other Karuizawas, slightly more docile. The same interplay of sweet berries and dark prunes, spices (thyme, cumin, nutmeg) and earthy smoke. Bergamot and blood oranges in a second wave. Then back to tobacco leaves and some very light medicinal herbs. Finish: very long, but this is where it looses a point. Drier than the Nepal bottling, showing more earthy notes, more smoke and more tannins, eased by some chocolate and eucalyptus.One of the best Karuizawa noses ever, in my opinion.

Sweet baked mango and baked apple too. Mouth is really concentrated baked fruits with spices that range from Christmas to Indian restaurant (cardamom syrup). Quite heavy and pungent mouth. Water brings out more old Highland Park tones, brighter and festive. ""Orange oils"" keeps coming into my head. One of the better old Zawa casks I've tried.  "

4568,Karuizawa 1981  Noh Whisky,"Medium copper pour.  Nose is strong on charred oak, caramel, perhaps some cherry compote.  It's quite bourbon-like as the peat is mild and there are lots of strong, charred notes and burned sugars going on.  Mouth is a lot of alcohol heat and a touch of savory beef marinade upfront, then sweet cherry jam and lots of those bourbon flavors.  As it breaths some dried mushroom opens up.  Then an odd note on the finish that's like an aged lambic beer, a straight gueuze in fact.  Faintly funky, I suppose...wild yeast? Other cool bright notes on the finish.  This is good and quite odd.After drinking from this for some weeks, it's improved a lot.  Great rum cake and rich sweetness.  Savories of wood ear mushroom, soft Indian spices.  Continues to evolve and improve."
4569,Karuizawa 1981  Noh Whisky,"This is similar in profile to other 1981's, but with more of an edge and less softness. It has less finesse, and is not as seductive and perfumed as others from the vintage (think cocktail). A bit strong on summer fruits and a tad biting, but otherwise delicious and unique like good old Karuizawa. Maybe has a wildness that's more exciting as well."
4570,Karuizawa 1981  Noh Whisky,"Nose: Syrupy and tightly wound cherries latrices. Brown sugar soup. Soy sauce, smoked Chinese pork ribs (light sulfur?) Moss, earthy mushrooms and old, nourished forest. A little closed, too. With time, oaky rancio, smoke, inscrutable wall of dark fruit, lots of chocolate. Nuts, marzipan, almond extract. Spun sugar and sugar cane almost fermenting. Menthol, too. A bit lighter as it goes on. (with water) Cinnamon, ginger, and soft malty sherry. Honeyed spun sugar comes out. Brown sugar, salty/savory elements become more diffuse. Dry oak with some tannic orange note.Palate: Warm, but really rich and chewy. Ham, soy sauce, cherries, soft strawberries and sherry notes, hoisin sauce. Oranges, leather, brown sugar, armagnacy wood. Heavy coffee, ginger. Dry, for one. (with water) Water calms it down, yet it's still thick and very oily. Loses some fruit, rather more on richly sweet maltiness, and more of that saucy Chinese/Japanese salt and deluxe soy and oyster sauce.Finish: A graceful finish of the slightly sweet savory. And maybe just a hint of weak coffee. Palate feels almost clean after a while. This is a very elegant dram, though the finish is short and the fruit is on the edge. More robust with air in the bottle, and really shows off the kind of awesome luxury ham and soy that Karuizawa sometimes does. This is one that must not be rushed, and get better with time and age. I go back and forth on this, it left me wanting and hoping for more, but there's no denying its excellence."

Really old and exotic - so must smell old whisky! Unfortunately, a bit too sour to be over 90.  Taste: soft and supple with some tingling wood and a lot of plum, dark fruits and wood polish, again some tannins and old wet wood.  In the finish only wood and some smoke. Very bitter coffee, dark chocolate and tart oak. Light smoke and charcoal. Very long and (I can not stress it often enough) woody remains almost forever in the mouth!  A pity that was too long in the barrel - great paints but you have to stand on intensive wood!

(it is not written on this one but on his sister cask with the red label)  I am a little dubious. The complexity is there but it's not my favorite Karuizawa style, and here the alcohol is not very well integrated.30 years of sherry cask a priori. But the cask is much less marked than in many Karuizawa. We have a vanilla and a floral side that makes me think more of bourbon ...  Fruits rather yellow and white (green apple, peach, Italian white grape, rhubarb). Pepper, wood and a large amount of solvent, wax. We are far from classic sherry.  Alcohol is present.  The water adds an even more floral side, purple and lilac.In the mouth we stay on a similar profile.  The fruits are there, just like wax and pepper.  We have honey and a little chocolate.  The wood is present but the bitterness comes from a good chocolate powder.Finale on chocolate, plum and wood."

A so tangible (but not at all unpleasantly so) vanilla, nice lively fresh spices and a quite perfect malty sweetness. Add a dryish somewhat sooty smokiness to that. Makes up a pretty good nose. Wow.

4621,Karuizawa 1981  Noh Whisky,"On my nose I received dark syrup, red apples, oak tree, figs, caramel knuckle, some ginger, orange marmalade, coffee, leather; hint of passion fruit and pepper. The taste was sweet, with toffee, dark syrup, anise, some pepper and hints of smoke, key and a little mineral note. The ending was half-dry and long, with toffee, some smoke, red apples and cocoa. With some water there was some cardamom on the nose, along with menthol, vanilla, coca cola (ginger, toffee) and red apples. The flavor got more cocoa and sherry, with some clearer mineral notes. The finish got more oak tree, with some licorice and more malt.  Here, I think the nose was better than taste and ending, which might be a little dry and mineral, if absolutely critical. Better losses are found, but this is equally a superb Karuizawa.  Grade: 91/100"

Maybe not the most complex, but very rich and well-balanced.A subtle hint of peat (more present than in the nose), some brine. Then old, dirty sherry. Leather, burlap and wood polish. Pretty spicy with a fair amount of pepper.Peat smoke, but very soft. Spicy, fresh oak and a hint of caramel. Nice and long."

Perfect harmony, great aroma between light smoke, tobacco, oak and a wonderful saliva-stimulating sweetness. Added to this is an excellent sherry keg that has left unseated ""wet"" notes but has been able to release its entire class to the whisky over the long ripening period, producing wonderful oxidation notes.

4660,Karuizawa 1981,"Is this the epitome of Karuizawa greatness? Some say a Karuizawa is like an emperor with no clothes, but I guess they haven't tried some of these true gems. TWE said this cask may be one of the best there is. I cannot disagree with that statement. Unbelievably complex, old, thick, sherry, full of umami (yes, I am actually salivating), old leather and tobacco, and very clean (i.e. no sulfur). Flavors are balanced, doesn't have a lot of alcohol sting, and I do not detect any of the typical Karuizawa wildness.Oh, I take that back. All the Karuizawa flavor is here, very explosive, but at the same time, quite elegant if that makes sense. A hint of expensive mushrooms (morel, porcini), a bit nutty, ever the slightest sulfur, but man, this feels nice. The Karuizawa wildness is restrained by the deep, old, complex sherry -- they work side by side. Lots and lots of raisins. Dr. Pepper cola. Soy sauce without the salt. Great syrupy mouthfeel. Nice and long. A bit of spice now. Cherry cough syrup. Sweet cola at the end. "
4661,Karuizawa 1981,"Dark ""old sherry"" color, thick.  Intense, dark aroma.  Ranges from savory (wood ear mushrooms, rich beef stock) to fruity (blueberry puree, candied cherries) to sweet (rich sherry, dried fruits).  Pungent, as with other old Zawas.  The marriage between the malt and the cask here is exceptional.  Mouth is rife with dark fruit compote, even so much as fig at times, steak marinade, black walnut, exotic liqueurs.  Keeps changing from blueberry puree to Japanese mushroom to savory beef elements. Fantastic!Edit: It's been open and drank from for a couple months. Still great, though much more about pipe tobacco, and sometimes mint, than it was before. Meaty, savory, umami."

The mouth is not outdone even if I would spend more time with (1cl, it goes so fast).  I need a face to face with the # 152.  Thanks Andy for the dram.This nose is a marvel and a rare aromatic power.  A slap of wood and eucalyptus arrive directly in the nose.  We also feel an ubiquitous acidity with blackcurrant. A bit of ripe banana is also there with a little rum pineapple.  The precious Karuizawa wood is there in all its splendor. Old and dusty.  A large dose of leather is also present, as are aromas of undergrowth.  Liquorice, 90% chocolate. Cigar smoke.  What complexity. Everything is there and everything is imposing.  With the opening the smoke becomes intoxicating, between the cigar and the barbecue. Duck breast with pink flesh and caramelized on the edges. We also have some kirsch and more berries.In the mouth, red fruits stand out and mix with dusty wood.  We also have a big dose of undergrowth, earth, pu ehr.  Bold leather is here to add an oily side.  Bitter black cocoa.This very long finish and warms up.  On precious wood, undergrowth, licorice, blackberry jam and fresh mint."

Wood that can sniff for hours without getting tired, which probably comes from a high quality drum.  Immediately, we are accompanied by notes of camphor and eucalyptus. It's fresh. Clove is added to this medicinal cocktail.  We then arrive in a more animal register, with well-grilled meat, a little smoke and earth. Leather.  On the fruit side, exoticism dominates, followed by some red fruits. A little side sweet candy spring.In the mouth, we do not feel the 58%.  The fruit is present, exoticism and red fruits stand out above all, in the form of a very balanced jam.  The spices are there, the leather too, and the wood too.  The animal side take over as and to give more expression to a slight smoke.Long finish, more earthy than the mouth, on gunpowder, dust and eucalyptus. The grilled meat.  The fruits are more indented."

4696,Karuizawa 1982  Carpe Koï Serie,"Karuizawa 1982/2012 (46%, Number One Drinks, The Whisky Exchange, first fill bourbon, cask #8497)  Colour: full gold. Nose: it’s obviously not one of these wonderfully dirty-ish heavily sherried Karuizawas and in fact, the freshness and the fruitiness are quite impressive. What strikes me as well is the little smokiness, the touches of pinesap and eucalyptus – not to mention camphor – and, well, the Japanese side, hard to describe. Or maybe between sandalwood and incense? Other than that, there’s a little varnish (cellulose), touches of pencil shavings, vanilla and quite some tarte tatin (caramelised apples). A Karuizawa that may hint at other famous and beautiful Japanese malts, such as Yoichi. Mouth: I think that was very clever to reduce this baby down to 46%, because the oak’s slightly loud in the attack, just after a few fleeting notes of tinned pineapples. Mind you, not excessively so but it’s all rather less creamy and syrupy than other ex-first fill bourbons, which gives this baby a faint planky side (plus tea, cinnamon, nutmeg…) The rest is pretty perfect, with some lemon zest, some ginger tonic, quinces, apple pie and fresh cider apples. Finish: quite long, a little softer but the spices remain there, between white pepper, ginger and cinnamon. Touches of horseradish in the aftertaste. Comments: brilliant nose and a palate that’s a tad too oaky for me. Just a tad! SGP:461 - 88 points.Whiskyfun.com"
4697,Karuizawa 1982  Carpe Koï Serie,"After a lot of bottle ageing, this plays like an almost tropical Brora. Even better with time.Spirity and somewhat volatile. It has a hard citric core, lemon juice and pineapple nearly, with sandalwood powder. Candied vanilla and honeyed bourbon. Some light and sugary dried tropical fruits - pineapple, papaya, and mango, too. It's definitely sweet, almost on cake frosting, and a pinch of cloves and cinnamon. With time, the slightly odd plastic feistiness blows off, but a darker, bitter wood character remains.A bit light and medium body, and the flavors are rather subdued and mellow at first. Immediately on lemon cream tart with a bitter crust. Vanilla cake and honeyed flowers on top. Clean oak, creating an odd combination - the wood is plainly alike a high quality Bourbon showing great wood, but with yellow fruits and a rather more whiskied character. Tree bark? A waxiness emerges with time, and presents itself like a Clynelish without the smoke. Maybe a hint of apple peel as well.Fairly sweet and on the same elements, yet also a bit drying and the touch of bitterness from the wood."
4698,Karuizawa 1982  Carpe Koï Serie,"N: Ethanol, [all-purpose] cleaning solvent, cacao/cocoa, citrus, stringent wood and copper fillings, reminiscent of Nikka Coffey grain. Not overly inspiring noseT: Ethanol hit but never overpowering, never harsh - takes its time to unwind. Creamy, oily, husky, lemon cleaning fluid with a body that is clean and dirty at the same time.  Intense woody, oily citrus… [something], strong and concentrated like an essential oil.  Deep bodied arrival and development which coats the whole tongue - very impressive and characterful.F: ….cocoa, limey citrus and the milky skin formed on the surface of a hot chocolate. Cocoa, water from copper pipes [or sucking on a two pence piece], and saline notes at the death. Long long finish. Used fireworks from charred wood comes twenty minutes later.C: . This didn’t wow me and it took some work. Furthermore it shares similar traits throughout to the Nikka Coffey grain, a malt thats a fraction of the price if you can find it. Undeniably though this Karuizawa has ‘something’ you don’t get from other malts. Nothing special for me on the nose but a fabulous body, development and gunpowder after the death reveal its qualities.Scores a B+"

4702,Karuizawa 1982  Geisha Label,"This whisky has been beautifully opened since November and has given me a real happiness. The rubbery notes disappeared, it remains a huge Japanese sherry monster. But it remains heavy and the mouth is very hot without water. Not to propose to the first comer so!Oxidation did a good job. The nose is a little alcoholic, but the smell of rubber that I was so tired has almost disappeared. It remains a faint echo, and the gourmet and vinous notes of sherry finally express themselves fully. And good sherry, full of dried fruits (nuts), rancio, milk chocolate, coffee, plus varnish typical of the Japanese. Superb. With water: even more greedy, with the addition of organic notes (mushrooms).The mouth remains overpowering and oily, with organic flavors (black mushrooms) and vinous. A dash of water is needed: yes, it's better. A nice acidity appears on the attack (orange juice), then the mouth develops on the dark chocolate while the oak expresses on the spices (ginger, cinnamon). And surprise, at the end of the mouth, a hint of peanut smoked.Long, asses, but fresher than the mouth (the sensation that leaves a menthol Kool on the palate), it ends on notes of plum."

4711,Karuizawa 1983,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2018/05/17/loving-yourself-is-the-most-important-job-of-all/N: First time I tried this rare malt I picked up lots of bacon Frazzles [blog]. Today I find it a touch smokey [in a Laphroaig=Caol Ila kind of way], with a malty-freshness, fusty malted barley,… aah, here comes the bacon - that didn’t take too long. I also get the loft insulation note I picked out before. Having spent some time in my loft in the last few days, there is something loft-y about it as well as something of a chimney - smokey bacon by the fireside then. Also some bergamot, dates, dried lemons, sweet grapefruit pith,…. At the core it displays deep smokey ash layers with foosty barley and fusty oak. Much like the Yamazaki, there’s a cohesion to the whole presentation with an experience that slips past descriptors & ingredients and to a realm more abstract & emotional - and I’m anything but open to emotion today. Herbal oaky sugars begin to develop more fully after around 30 minutes. Outshines the very decent Yamazaki by some margin.T: Starts with a huge & wide abv hit. Not much for the angels during those 31 years. Along with the concentrated sugars - all manner of fruits, teas & jams, the Islay-esque smokiness is never lost. I wonder if anyone would dare finish a Karuizawa in an Islay cask? Bit too late now anyway. Things are pretty much as ideal as you’d want from such a bold style of whisky. You can make it as complicated as you want or simply add water, sip and let it sit on the palate whilst enjoying the sightseeing. Deep permeated teak & oak furniture oils shine through on the turn, followed by a bitter fruity dark chocolate liqueur to die for.F: Appears to grow larger and larger as it goes on. Still with that smokey bacon note, we’ve malty/putty, waxy ashy sugars and something you may find in the occasional exceptional rum. The smokey oakiness pervades deep, the malted peated barley never too far away. Bitter-sweet smokey embers conclude.C: I reckon a bottle would last a while, given how full-on it is - even more so than the Yamazaki. I wonder how many of the 50 bottles will be opened and savoured? At time of writing, 14 of those 50 bottles are claimed by 8 Whiskybase members and some have appeared at festivals - giving people like myself the pleasure. Happily sticking with my previous super high score.Scores an A[+]"
4712,Karuizawa 1983,
4713,Karuizawa 1983,"N: An incredible blended complexity with bacon Frazzles, more bacon - and loft insulation, such is the dryness.T: Same as the nose, fabulous everythin [even the insulation]. I wouldn’t dare add water to such a small sample.F: Simply amazing. Such a youthfulness with all that provenance and time past.

4714,Karuizawa 1983,"whiskynotes.be:Karuizawa 1983 ‘Nepal Appeal’ (59%, OB for The Whisky Exchange 2014, sherry cask #3557, 50 btl.)Nose: delicious. It has this combination of juicy cherries, tobacco leaves and a lightly ethereal touch of exotic wood – three things that pretty much define a great Karuizawa in my opinion. Moelleux au chocolat. Prunes, mocha and hazelnuts, a little incense. Eucalyptus and After Eight. Some meaty and flinty notes, dry cinnamon and a little balsamic after a while. Quite excellent. Mouth: thick, leathery and very spicy without water. Lots of cinnamon, cumin and pepper. Coffee powder and huge tobacco notes. Strong fruit tea and lightly medicinal hints of liquorice and mint. Still some prunes, figs, black cherries and fudge in the background. It takes quite a bit of water, which releases more fruits (even some pink grapefruit and bergamot) and highlights the aromatic cedar / sandalwood. Finish: very long, rather dry, on cocoa powder, pepper and blackberries.There aren’t many 1983 expressions available, but most of them have been great. I can only confirm this is an excellent, very heavy Karuizawa. If you have the money to spare, this would be a unique way to support Nepal and get a rare Karuizawa in return. Score: 93/100"
4715,Karuizawa 1983,"Nonjatta:Karuizawa 1983/2015, #3557, 59%abv, 50 bottlesOn the nose, the initial impressions are venison with balsamic prune sauce, honey-bourbon glazed barbecued ribs, mango chutney, old leather, old cigar boxes (the boxes themselves, not so much the cigars!) but it’s also got a bit of a Sicilian side to it, with cartocci siciliani, buccellati and mpanatigghi on the table. There’s also a bit of rosemary, thyme and some caraway lying about. When you spend more time with it, you may pick up hints of shiso leaf and strawberry-and-fennel compote. After a good 15 minutes, there are distinct notes of mimolette, porcini risotto and a teeny tiny (but oh so, delightful) trace of ruby grapefruit. Tasting notes are always partial – not only in the sense of revealing but a fraction of ‘what’s there’ (assuming there is such a thing), but also in the sense of revealing what the taster is partial to – but with these sort of Golden Age (i.e. early 80s) Karuizawas, you really could go on forever… The thing is: there’s a thousand things going on but there is no excess whatsoever in this case – which you can’t always say about 30+yo Karuizawas.In the mouth, it’s the liquid equivalent of “The Odyssey” – what a journey! It starts with an intense citrus attack – not quite the sudachi that’s a signature note of old (and I mean pre-80s) Karuizawas, but something between lime and sudachi. Then, you get grapefruit peel, beef jerky, blueberry barbecue pulled pork, smokedkinmedai and burdock, ume plum jam, mole sauce, but there’s more… smoked chocolate chips, a fig log, espresso liqueur… the list goes on and on. This is like a whole week of fine dining rolled into a single dram. In that sense, Karuizawa is not all that expensive, come to think of it. You can just slowly work your way through a bottle of this, and feel like you’ve been eating in the world’s most fabulous restaurants for months on end.The finish is long and fairly drying but pleasantly so… with the strawberry-and-fennel coming back, some bramble cinnamon crumble and a bit of shichimi.Water tames the nose somewhat and makes it more approachable… but it fades out some of the aromatic ‘partials’ (to use an analogy from sonology) that give the nose that gritty wildness that’s so beguiling … well, personally speaking. On the palate, water dials up the citrus (Seville oranges, which you often get in early 80s Karuizawas at some point during the journey from glass to memory) and stewed fruits. It also brings out more of the wood. On the finish, with water, you get somehojicha, golden raisins, white pepper and a sliver of fresh mint.What can we say? It’s up there with the best early-80s Karuizawas… but there’s only 50 bottles. Life can be a cruel…"
4716,Karuizawa 1983,"Karuizawa 1983/2015 'Nepal Appeal' (The Whisky Show, cask #3557, 50 bottles) Some Karuizawa! Bottled in support of Nepal and exclusive to one very high-end masterclass at The Whisky Show in London on October 6. Colour: mahogany. Nose: chocolate and lit cigars. So smoking some kind of dark maduro Cohiba while opening the very best Spanish (okay, dear Italian friends, Italian) dark chocolate, while having a glass of old Port Mourant rum on the side.So it’s a whole experience, not just whisky. And not only that, there’s also a smoky cup of old pu-erh tea, a good five old books (Hemingway…. But of course) and… hold on, concrete? Stones and flints? Coal crumbles? Old crème de menthe? Mushrooms? Black trumpets, to be more precise? With water: old books, old leather, old wine cellar, old creams, old embrocations, old dry wines, fresh mint cream. Chocolate mint. Mouth (neat): warning tooh-tooh-tooh, warning! This is strong, violent, brutal, and probably not totally civilised. Starts with soups and bouillons, so very Karuizawa, and pretty ‘uma-mi-esque’. I’m sure Uma Thurman used to drink this while they were shooting Kill Bill – and I agree, it showed. Then chocolate, dried figs, all raisins (Corinth, Smyrna, Sultanas, all that), then this Armagnacky side that’s also often to be found in Karuizawa, so prunes, then cigars and plenty of black earth. Licking the ground in an old forgotten factory. With water: I didn’t now they were still having some of these casks. Not sure this would still be legal. Plums and dried dates, old PX, bitter oranges, gasoline, engine oil, Russian black tea, rust, silverware, sucking old pennies, black truffles… Quite unmanageable, all this. Finish: too long, too huge, too dominant, too concentrated. To be honest, it’s a bit tiring! Comments: it fights with you, and it’s not impossible that untrained whisky enthusiasts would give up after just two minutes. You might want to do a bit of training before tackling this monster of a whisky. SGP:474 - 93 points."

Great drop and it makes you want to discover more of this kind in the future. Everything is just right here - very high level from the first nose to the last sip.Surprisingly smoky (in the direction of smoked ham), dusty wood, balsamic vinegar, old leather jacket of a pipe smoker, game spice, plums, lots of oak (coffee, old oak cupboard and light wood acid). The flavors really overwhelming - sherry and old wood at the ready!Wow the skin pure - full-bodied, aromatic and woody. Full board old board. It explodes properly. Subtle smoke, herbal sweets, plum jam, warming spices, tobacco, rum sweetness and, as already mentioned, oak (chocolate with 90% cocoa and violent espresso).  Just as complex and overwhelming as the nose. Just great !Damn long finish and mega intense. Herbal liqueur, rum sweetness again and now even heavy smoke (greasy), viscous PX sherry, dark chocolate and old tobacco can, very woody but not yet in the uncomfortable area. Wow it stays forever.  If you like sherry and wooden boards, you are in the whisky heaven. You have to look for a longer finish for a long time."
4727,Karuizawa 1983  Noh Whisky - Chorei Beshimi,"Nose: This is very much in line with Karuizawa 'Noh' bottlings that I've had; a touch darker, heavier, and richer in profile. Fig, prune, plum, dates. Coffee, high cacao chocolate that's just slightly melted. Slightly citric like from oak tannins in an elderly Armagnac. Mushrooms, sandalwood, thin salty smoked meat, raisins, and dried flower petals. Loads and loads of tobacco and cigar. (with water) fruitier and the notes are sweeter and jammier. slightly more extracted, in a good way, more refined and elegant, and at least as good.Palate: Thick and wonderfully rich. Tobacco, cigar wrapper, syrup, rum, licorice, anise, various liqueurs. There is a plastic quality, but it just works, oddly enough, playing a good role in the transition of flavors across the palate. More chocolate, malt, and coffee. (with water) Water subdues the flavors a touch, just a touch, but all the flavors are there and still very strong. New notes of, yep, chili and ginger. Chocolate is a bit more obvious.Finish: More of the same, and more bitter coffee grinds (small quantity - a little goes a long way, and this makes you want more). Salty-smoky meat, lit cigar, tobacco, and all the rest. There really IS something to these Noh bottlings. This was fantastic. I'll have to *ahem* open my bottle before too long."

4729,Karuizawa 1983  Noh Whisky - Chorei Beshimi,"When these sort of whiskies were released by Speciality Drinks THEY WERE round £150-£200 which to me as a drinker would be a fair price.This one was way over the edge and too woody.The nose is by far the best part.Tasted with 5 drops of water.Obviously heavy sherry, thick plump raisins, dark juicy plum, black currant, dark soy sauce, something meaty, beef dripping.I suppose you would describe this as the obligatory heavy sherry Karuizawa nose.Bittersweet is my first thought, like everything the nose suggested fruit wise, stewed.The problem is with this one is that it is sour basically and to me not particulalrly enjoyable .The nose gives a false impression there is much more wood on the palate than the nose hints at.Certainly a very meaty sherry but any fruit sweetness is swamped by the wood and meaty bitterness, the sweeter fruit is fighting for it's life.Difficult to score, maybe a dark orange tint at the end.Finally at the very end some sweetness pushes through, but far too late to save it."

A mixture of dried fruits with sandalwood, leather and tobacco. Strong notes of dried mangos, also prunes, raisins, and red berry jam. There is a delicate sweetness with marzipan and cake.I could spend hours with nosing this whisky.Powerful and bold, an explosion of aromas, warming from deep inside. Sweet Ricola cough drops, liquorice and toffee. Surprisingly I taste citrus fruits as well. Long, fruity and spicy, with the aromas from the palate lingering on."

Colour: dark amber. Nose: we’re roughly in the same category as the older ones from two or three years ago (1967 and such). That is to say that it’s ridden with incense, sandalwood, pipe tobacco and crème de menthe at first nosing, just before a massive combination of chocolate, prunes, coffee, peonies, eucalyptus and dried beef (Grisons meat) starts to strike. With water: figs and dates galore! And raisins, leather cream, old balsamic vinegar, almond oil… Truly wonderful. Mouth (neat): exceptional! Sure it’s a tad bitter and very ‘extractive’ (Jaegermeister) at very first sips, but the richness and the complexity are astounding, especially since the whole is also quite nervous (lemon) and anything but too thick – so it’s not cloying at all. The best pipe tobaccos. Menthol. With water: blimey, there isn’t the tiniest flaw in there, although it becomes a notch narrower with water. Maybe… Finish: long, fruity, jammy, spicy. Touches of green oak in the aftertaste, that’s were this baby’s maybe a little less stunning and loses one or two points.Comments: these babies are pretty unbeatable. Both massive and very elegant whiskies, not too sure Scotland can beat them fair and square. SGP:662 - 93 points. whiskyfun.com"

Far from the sherry monsters, it’s rather a marvellous blend of Virginia tobacco, dried apricots, quince jelly, beeswax, linseed oil and just touches of old books. Vanilla pods. With water: yaaay! Absolutely wonderful, almondy, waxy, phenolic, resinous, mentholated… And quite medicinal, but not in an Islay way. And a great earthiness in the background. In truth, there’s something bourbonny, in a great way. Mouth (neat): extremely creamy and superbly herbal. Warning, it’s quite extreme in fact, with some very strong cumin, mint, juniper and cinnamon, but it's, well, stunning. Also something like lemon-flavoured marzipan. Eucalyptus Lozenges, thyme. With water: a white-oakiness comes out a little more, with more sweet ginger and a little encaustic. Finish: long, lemony. Cinnamon, nutmeg, more lemon-flavoured marzipan and touches of limoncello. A little curry in the aftertaste. Strong tea as well in the aftertaste. Comments: the oak became a little louder with water, this one was ahead of the Noh on the nose but I liked that one’s palate a little better because the oak was less obvious.

4748,Karuizawa 1984,
4749,Karuizawa 1984  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"This Karuizawa 1984 vintage single malt whisky is dark amber in color. It was distilled in 1984 by the Karuizawa distillery, thirty years later, in 2014, married by the Number One Drinks Company and bottled for “La Maison Du Whisky”. Its alcohol content is 58.5% vol. Some whisky lovers speak of the KARUIZAWA 1984 Single Malt Whisky Cask 8173 as one of the best and most complex ex-bourbons, which was made from the distillates that were still in stock after the closure of the Karuizawas distillery. Tasing Notes Smell: The nose is most likely to be reminiscent of beautiful, magnificent forests, including polished oak, eucalyptus and other precious woods. Rosewood could also be among them. Taste: At the same time it tastes a bit smoky and of chalk. But nuances of dry sherry or vin jaune as well as walnut notes can also be tasted. These flavors are supplemented by some humus and various mushrooms. After about two minutes you think you can taste a strawberry or two. If the whisky is diluted with a little water or ice, the menthol taste really comes into its own. This is reminiscent of old herbal liqueurs and verbenas and suggests a mixture of essential oils. This taste calms down after a minute at the latest. The whisky tastes incredibly fruity on the palate. A massive taste of wood is evident, but by no means makes it appear dry. Now there are also aromas of sweet citrus fruits such as kumquats, oranges and tangerines, which in turn seem to be covered with crushed cloves and ground pepper. Some people inevitably think of Christmas when they hear this taste. If the whisky is diluted with water or ice is added to it, it has the same taste profile, but appears even more lively and ""nervous"". Finish: A long, but pleasant, fresh oak taste ensures the finish. Summary of the product Distillery: Karuizawa Year of birth: 1984 Bottled: 2014 Taste: Nose: taste of different woods, smoky, of chalk, sherry, walnut. Palate: wood, very fruity, sweet citrus fruits (kumquats, mandarins, oranges), cloves, pepper, finish: oak taste. Single barrel filling, Barrel type: old sherry barrels, wood type of the barrels unknown, Alcohol: 58.5% vol. Cask No .: 8173 Cask Type: Ex Bourbon Cask Contents: 0.7 liters Origin: Japan"
4750,Karuizawa 1984  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"The 1984 vintage is perhaps one of the most coveted of all Karuizawa vintages, it is amazing that we can still find it. Matured in bourbon cask, 363 bottles were produced and sold exclusively by La Maison Du Whisky, Paris."
4751,Karuizawa 1984  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Serge Valentin (92)Colour: dark amber. Nose: a pretty magnificent woodiness here, that is to say not only polished oak, but also other species, such as eucalyptus wood and many precious woods, but I just couldn’t tell you which ones. Maybe rosewood? I imagine the interior of a 1950’s Rolls Royce when it was brand new (maybe!) Other than that, there’s a little smoke, there’s tobacco for sure and there’s a faint chalkiness. I also find dry sherry, or vin jaune, as well as their walnut notes. Also a little humus and mushrooms. Perfect. One strawberry or two after ten minutes. With water: the menthol comes out, old herbal liqueurs, verbena, chartreuse… This is almost a blend of essential oils. Having said that it gets much quieter after just one minute. Mouth (neat): huge and incredibly fruity! You would think that this massive woodiness would overwhelm the spirit and just make the whole extremely dry, while that’s exactly what’s not happening. We’re gravitating around sweeter citrus, that is to say kumquats, oranges and mandarins, covered with crushed cloves and ground pepper. Christmassy? You said it. With water: same profile, just even more vivid and ‘nervous’. Perfect oranges. Finish: long, never embarrassingly oak, always fresh albeit massive. The hidden child of a sumotori and a ballerina. Comments: I think I found this one ampler and more complex than other ex-bourbon Karuizawas. We’re close to the best sherried versions in my opinion!"

4753,Karuizawa 1984  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Tasted beside Glen Moray 1959 Samaroli. Copper amber pour, much lighter than the Glen Moray. Nose is gamey, funky, old dried mushrooms, dried fruits -- everything an old Zawa should be. Mouth is brighter than the Samaroli, with almost a lime citrus brightness that comes across. But there's much more of course - exciting dried fruits (cherries, cranberries), some of that old ""wood ear"" mushroom that great Zawas seem to have, and a good dose of alcohol heat. Not surprisingly, it's hotter than the Samaroli. Dare I say more exciting too. You definitely start to get a really neat flavor that's very pleasantly medicinal, like some exotic cough syrup. With water - tones down the heat and funkiness, brings out more elegant, sweeter flavors: candied oranges, a touch of red berries, and also menthol, mint. So interesting! Yes, it's less refined and ""kingly"" than the Samaroli, but I might prefer it a bit in how diverse and changing it is, and how it does so many things well at once."

Malted barley, sherry with rancio, dried fruits (date, fig), orange zest and red fruits (strawberry, raspberry, morello cherry) compete in intensity. ""eau-de-vie, animal notes (leather), liquorice stick, pipe tobacco and heady flowers (iris).  Palate: dense, fleshy. She has a chest. She affirms loudly her oriental identity, loukum, mint tea and falafel. With a great finesse, the mid-palate breathes an offshore wind that deposits spray on the taste buds and notes of barley fields. The rigor of its distillate admires the youthful expression of this vintage 1984.  Final: long, silky. Its precious woodiness has hints of apricot pie, quince jelly and fresh fig, and extends to walnut, geranium flower and incense. The retro-olfaction is malty and the empty glass marked by chlorophyll and noble spices.  Comment LMDW: It's single malts for which everything seems easy, obvious, natural. Karuizawa is undeniably one of those. This 1984, is in line with the finest sherry casks of the distillery, at once balanced, complex and deep.

An old sherry cask builds the decor: nuts, roasted hazelnuts, light touch of old balsamic vinegar (the authentic, not the ersatz that has invaded the grocery stores), a little anise, coffee, cocoa, old woodwork, orange Seville ... All traversed by a volute of smoke both powerful and distant. Net, nuanced, elegant. Its austerity is that of a quiet cloister: soothing, conducive to meditation.The attack is supple, almost shy, even watery despite the 57.7% and then the smoke quickly invades the palate on a background of orange, spices, pipe tobacco.Medium, on burnt wood, tart notes and smoke.

It reminds me of the olden times when I used to smoke cigars, especially when I came across my first 50-cabinet of Lusitanias, around 1990. That was at Gérard’s in Geneva and… but why am I telling you all this utterly uninteresting nonsense? A magnificent nose anyway. With water: smoke and ashes! Mouth (neat): beats them all. Especially the wee blend of aniseed, mint and eucalyptus is superb. Wait, are we sure Karuizawa weren’t actually making… cough syrup for the Emperor of Japan? I also find a touch of ‘good’ soap. With water: a massive camphory semi-dry sherry. Finish: very long, earthy, slightly mentholated again. Corinthian raisins.

4786,Karuizawa 1984  Carpe Koï Serie,"[August, 2017]  Why not a Karuizawa head-to-head?  I am in the mood to do this 1984 versus a 15-year old from 1992 https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/7178/karuizawa-1992 selected by the Whisky Magazine.Colour:  The 1984 is auburn and the 1992 is one shade paler at russetmuscat.  The texture of the 1992 shows just a sticky fat ring at the top of the glass that very very late form some sticky tears (no legs at all).  Now this is what I call a fat and oily malt.  The 1984 does basically the same so both promise a great mouthfeel.Nose:  The 1992 nose is very punchy (60,4% abv) first and after you adopted to this a subtle, complex and clean old-style sherry profile shines through, really adorable.  The nose of the 1984 is bolder and even more complex, I like it much more (especially the leathery aspects).  Mouthfeel:  The 1992 arrives quite hot on the palate and coats the mouth nicely (just as the texture promised).  No bitter or adstringent moments.  The 1984 is even more coating and owns some slight bitter notes from heavy tannins (that are not unpleasant to me).  Again I like the 1984 better.Taste:  The 1984 offers a rich and multi-layered taste that in some aspects reminds me of a delicious old rum (e.g., from Caroni).  The 1992's taste is lighter and hidden behind the high alcohols, it really cries for water so I added some.  Now it gets smoother and more accessible but still it is rather shy and not what I would call a great dram.  Even more water does not help it just flattens the dram.  This round wins the 1984 with an advantage of 4 to 5 points.Finish:  The 1992 is rather short on this dimension and again very shy in its flavours and aromas (even when reduced with water).  Contrary to this the 1984 has a rich and long finish that nicely vanishes in different waves.  Again a big advantage for the older one with several points.Water opens the 1984 even further and adds some new aromas to the anyway complex profile while the 1992 does not really improve on water besides that it gets smoother.A surprising result:  While the 1984 kept the usually high expectations on a Karuizawa release the 1992 is average best (the nose is above but taste and finish are below average in my opinion).  Both are hopelessly overpriced - to give a hint:  As a drinker I am willing to pay around 200 to 250 Euros for the 1984 and not more than 50 to 70 Euro for the 1992.  Sounds crazy?  Think about who is crazy - me or the market?  To be honest, I do not care..."
4787,Karuizawa 1984  Carpe Koï Serie,"[June, 2017]  I had this dram together with a very good friend on a nice sunday afternoon.The colour is auburn and the texture shows many small sticky tears and no legs at all.  The nose is very punchy first (no wonder at 64,5% abv) but after a while it offers a beautiful clean sherry profile on nuts, raisins, orange peels and more, all in a great balance.  Not much of whisky aromas that I can detect at this high proof. The mouthfeel is just a little hot (surprisingly less given the abv) and peppery.  The taste is sherry sweet and quite closed when neat as is the finish.  Some drops of water open up the nose further and soothen the moutfeel.  The taste gets broader and nicely layered with some hints of peat, but it gets a little bitter too (tannins, of course).  The finish now is very long and sticks literally to the throat.  More water improve the nose further (the nuttiness turns into chocolate) and the taste offers now a spicy profile with dark chocolatey flavours.  And the bitterness that popped up with just some drops of water is now gone again.  This dram is an excellent swimmer and can stand even a fair share of water.  An excellent example of a whisky that changes its aromas and flavours literally with every drop of water you add.  Nevertheless completely over-hyped with a hyper-inflated price tag..."
4788,Karuizawa 1984  Carpe Koï Serie,"The whisky requires a lot of time. It's good for him to breathe for a while. The smell is like a pull that pulls you into the glass. A whisky to slow down.

A fantastic whisky, a work of artIt starts with the soothing glow of a fireplace, then, after a moment of contemplation, the flavors explode, so many, I can not tell it apart, sweet sherry, tobacco, blood orange, old paper, all very old and ripe, a touch in the background Lime, wet rotten woodA powerful start and a creamy body, the whisky lies like a piece of glowing coal on the tongue, then it is suddenly sweet, slightly tart oranges, very slightly astringent, an interplay of sweet and sour, oakIn the finish dominated by sweet oak, burnt sugar with a splash of orange juice, cocoa, very long, if you already believe that he is gone, it will be sweet, caramel and chocolate, whole milk now, in the end even comes once again Trace smoke"

4792,Karuizawa 1984  Carpe Koï Serie,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2019/07/09/smws-july-outturn-2019/N: Surprisingly smoky and/or toasted, only a touch farmy to start. Soon enough a long shopping list starts to form but I only note the much later arrival of oniony pickles with intense gingers and ginger cake, if left neat. The sherry cask’s previous contents is rather quiet. This one needs time and a few drams to experiment with and fortunately we have both. It’s an unusual & unique nose.T: Bob’s mate’s son joins in, offering a colourfully subjective & unrepeatable yet enlightening tasting perspective. For me, I found this very acute/strong to taste, smoky/toasted again, firmly savoury, spirity, heathery and oaky-dry. This needs and takes loads of water. After a number of whoa there’s, we find out from Bob that 50/50 seems the limit. This dilution brings savoury herbal qualities still with only a little sweetness. It has changed with water but doesn’t add any great significance to the delivery apart from toning down the ethanol. Either way, this is a brilliant and unusual whisky, the smokiness & the oakiness the main attributes – nowhere near over-oaked, just the taste of plain [yet not plain] oak.F: Stays smoky, savoury with a bitter-y dry-ish oakiness and a firm likeness [in my mind], to that beautiful 1996 Arran [WLP91]. The finish seems short at first, but with water it’s rather long and waxy. Later, bitter smoky tar, burnt rosemary, heather, fairly drying but the uniquely waxy mouthfeel grows once diluted. Clean yet spirity, light witch hazel conclusion – the ever-formidable 64.5% spirit never far away from the action.C: I reckon the Yamazaki 18yo would have suited the host better, but either way, the whisky was almost inevitably going to be trumped by the occasion surrounding it. “I don’t get it”, says Bob’s mate. “Just like background music”, says the pianist.It turns out I’ve had this before, almost exactly 5 years ago in the same place. My scoring was less informed then but I put it in the same ball-park. Thank you Bob."

4798,Karuizawa 1984  Single Cask - Number One Drinks Company,"A powerful Karuizawa. A magnificent rancio on the nose, which evolves into a surge of molasses. It's heavy, fat, but so pleasant. It takes time, a lot of time.A nose that begins with a very distinguished rancio. We are on a large dry fruit, almond, grilled hazelnut, walnut pie, plum, prunes, candied fruit. We could imagine ourselves on a very old cognac. Corinthian grape. A little molasses, tar. Right after the glass was served, we had a little sulfur, but aeration (1 hour in my case) almost makes it disappear. Noble, dry wood, toffee, light cigar. A nice dose of camphor. Great complexity and very nice balance. With even more ventilation, there is a slight aroma of button mushroom and bread apple.In the mouth, we continue with the same idea as the nose, but with a different balance. It is undoubtedly powerful and drying. Lots of wood, dust. Varnish, chocolate, cocoa, pepper, cloves. Molasses, soy sauce. Always a little tar, with liquorice, a little rubber. The fruit is set back, black and jammy. Blackberry, mainly plum.Long finish on fruits, plum, date. Light undergrowth, camphor, eucalyptus. Wood, dust, clove. It is more balanced than in the mouth."

So yeah, a lot of gunpowder and struck matches, and even truffles at first nosing, but no hard boiled eggs, asparagus or cooked cabbage in there. So no mercaptan/thiols, luckily. What’s more, as often those notes tend to go away, leaving room for quite some chocolate and raspberry jelly. Now, it’s very strong, so… With water: goes toward dried porcinis, cigars, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and, maybe, even old Parmesan cheese. Also bags and bags of roast chestnuts – I don’t think I ever got that that loudly. All that is quite lovely. Mouth (neat): rich and powerful, it’s more some kind of ultra-heavy jam at this point. Prunes, Armagnac, black pipe tobacco and a tarry/smoky side that may come from the high strength. Let’s see… With water: this time it became a little gamy and very dry, with this gunpowder that came back. Bitter chocolate, some ginger, heavy herbal liqueur (starting with a J., dear) or even this weird thing called Schinken häger. Ever tried that? Finish: long, dry, very chocolaty. Quite some white pepper. Smokier and ashier aftertaste."

4826,Karuizawa 1986  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Color :  Deep amber with golden tones.  Smell :  This is a very complex, deeply layered and concentrated whisky that takes time, in the glass, to breathe. Then the aromas are beautifully released with notes of pear candies, autumn fruit confiture, orange peel, lemon peel, cinnamon, clove, allspice, coriander, roasted coconut, prunes, figs, dates, sherry, raisins, toffee, sandalwood, chocolate, beeswax, a hint to sulfur, lily, leather, a hint of incense, tamarind, cassia, a hint of smoke, dried peach and a hint of fresh tarragon.  I have limited my smell experience here because of the space. However, there is so much in this deeply layered and mysterious whisky that I can not possibly get the most out of it all at once. This whisky can not be easily dissected and is perfect for hours to play in your glass before you even take a sip. What a beautiful, complex and unique bouquet!  Taste :  This is a very full, powerful, complex, mouth filling and deeply layered whisky. Many of the aromas of the fragrance also come back in the taste with extra notes of white pepper, chilli, antiques, varnish, leather, bergamot, lots of fruit, light bitter, tea, ginger, powerful wood tones, rosewood, tannin ( powerful but not predominant), nuts (cashew and walnut), cherries, coffee and old oxidized sweet sherry.  Unbelievable what is this whisky deep and complex. He is so concentrated that a drop of water releases a lot of new aromas. This is a wonderful taste experience that is so layered that it can keep you busy for a very long time. A beautiful masterpiece from this, unfortunately, closed Japanese distillery.

With more air, it gets some of the oxidative notes (more to 'brown' flavors with a slightly old wine and metalic overture). dark caramel and coffee emerge. cardamom, creamy vanilla, chocolate, and a touch of leather and polished wood. dates and then figs. Rich and very dense. (with water) demerara, and the oxidative notes are more prominent. Pie crust, caramel covered fruit, and older, nearly past-ripe strawberries.Palate: A bit warm at first. Heavily extracted sherry, pepper, and lots of wood and leather. What do we have here - nuts? Pecans, cashews, and pralines. Cherries and strawberries. Not the most complex, but certainly intriguing. (with water) Much more accessible. Honey, coffee, baking chocolate. Less wood and only a touch of fruit, but more pecans and oxidized wine (it's that medium aged sherry)Finish: long and excellent, between fruit and elegant dark wood. I really liked this, and there's a lot that reminds me, actually, of the macallan 18, though this packs a bit more verve and doesn't lose itself along the way with oxygen. Perhaps not as complex and deep as some, but I do tend to like these sorts of sherry bombs."

Mouth is also quite pungent and hot.  More of a Macallan type profile than some of the older Zawas, maybe that's because this is a young spirit than the early 80s Zawas that are very rich, concentrated, and sometimes very savory. There's definitely a good bit of fresh ginger root.  Finish is pretty bold and on the sweeter side, maybe a touch of red berries. Very good, may I say an approachable Karuizawa.  "

A little toffee-esque sweetness in the background, soft wood influence. Polish and leather. Pine/forest, a touch sour, and full of some stone fruit. Let's finish this as it began: Amazing.Thick and rich. Honey, wood, extracted sherry. Very light salt. Wood influence is fine, but you get a strong dose of bitterness in the middle. It's not a sweet sherry, but dry and darker on the palate that in the nose. Date-pineapple-papaya juice, but very trace. Really nice, but a let down compared to the nose.A bit brief, though it grows with more tasted. The nose is simply astounding. Chocolate, espresso, wood, and tropical elements.

Slight aroma of leaf mould.Water doesn't change it much - very ""new makey"" - feinty.A spicy attack with lots of alcohol bite. Then some oak. After a minute or two it gets a little of the plummy flavour of the Bladnoch New MakeThink this may need a little water to bring out its best.With water: A little smoother but otherwise unchanged. No, a trace of marzipan arrived as I typed that.Medium length with loads of oak. No, there's more of the fruit coming back. This is a longer finish than I thought."
4870,Karuizawa 1991  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"In the mouth and finish, it's very successful.  But the nose is however very disappointing for me. He is very young and we feel he had more to say than that.  It was probably 20 € at the time so good ... we get for the money of the time very widely.Slightly sulfurous nose unfortunately.  We have a big dose of red fruits. Cassis, blueberry, cherry.  It's quite beefy in alcohol (almost 62% at the same time.)  We have leather, eucalyptus. Medicinal. Pepper.  Very green wood that stings a bit (and yes, we are on an 11 year old Karuizawa!)In the mouth the alcohol is well integrated.  We are on a bed of dead leaves.  Fruits always present. Big leather too.  Dark chocolate, drying wood but nobler than the nose.Final long and a little drying.  On tobacco, leather, bark and pepper."

4882,Karuizawa 1992  Whisky Magazine - Editor's Choice,"[August, 2017]  Why not a Karuizawa head-to-head?  I am in the mood to do a 1984 https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/36383/karuizawa-1984 versus this 15-year old from 1992 selected by the Whisky Magazine.Colour:  The 1984 is auburn and the 1992 is one shade paler at russetmuscat.  The texture of the 1992 shows just a sticky fat ring at the top of the glass that very very late form some sticky tears (no legs at all).  Now this is what I call a fat and oily malt.  The 1984 does basically the same so both promise a great mouthfeel.Nose:  The 1992 nose is very punchy (60,4% abv) first and after you adopted to this a subtle, complex and clean old-style sherry profile shines through, really adorable.  The nose of the 1984 is bolder and even more complex, I like it much more (especially the leathery aspects). Mouthfeel:  The 1992 arrives quite hot on the palate and coats the mouth nicely (just as the texture promised).  No bitter or adstringent moments.  The 1984 is even more coating and owns some slight bitter notes from heavy tannins (that are not unpleasant to me).  Again I like the 1984 better.Taste:  The 1984 offers a rich and multi-layered taste that in some aspects reminds me of a delicious old rum (e.g., from Caroni).  The 1992's taste is lighter and hidden behind the high alcohols, it really cries for water so I added some.  Now it gets smoother and more accessible but still it is rather shy and not what I would call a great dram.  Even more water does not help it just flattens the dram.  This round wins the 1984 with an advantage of 4 to 5 points.Finish:  The 1992 is rather short on this dimension and again very shy in its flavours and aromas (even when reduced with water).  Contrary to this the 1984 has a rich and long finish that nicely vanishes in different waves.  Again a big advantage for the older one with several points. Water opens the 1984 even further and adds some new aromas to the anyway complex profile while the 1992 does not really improve on water besides that it gets smoother. A surprising result:  While the 1984 kept the usually high expectations on a Karuizawa release the 1992 is average best (the nose is above but taste and finish are below average in my opinion).  Both are hopelessly overpriced - to give a hint:  As a drinker I am willing to pay around 200 to 250 Euros for the 1984 and not more than 50 to 70 Euro for the 1992.  Sounds crazy?  Think about who is crazy - me or the market?  To be honest, I do not care..."

Hints of banana nut bread, walnuts, and mushrooms. It's another very good showing, even if not exceptional. Maybe even some apples and pears come up in the rear.Thick and rather oak-forward. Initially sweet, followed by an acidic bitterness from wood. Drying. Sharp cedar and extracted syrup from wood. Espresso grinds and chocolate. Bananas foster, glue, and some varnish. It's really a bit out of balance here and just doesn't do it for me.Sweet, dry, bitter, and sappy.

4892,Karuizawa 1992  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"Fantastic stuff.  A joy to drink.  I understand that they no longer use peated malt at Karuizawa.  I hope that works out for them, but on the basis of this, I'll be buying a bottle or two of the peaty stuff.Delightfully perfumed.  Floral with violets and heather (ironically) and lots of other summer flowers that seem familiar, but I cant separate out.  Hints of tropical fruits stored in hay, but the floral aromas are dominant.  No sign of wood that I can find, but there is smoke and lots of it.  But its not forceful.  It's like a peat fire that has burnt down and thrown off all the dampness and gently glows filling the room with wonderful tarry smells.  There's maybe a hint of elastoplast, but the medicinal smells are shy.  Just wonderful.The peat is there, but that amazing floral perfume just cuts through it and gives it a sweetness that waters the mouth.  Then the peat asserts itself.  Full on tarry flavours now.  Magnificent.Here comes the creosote and all the other things that have the peat-heads jumping for joy.  The finish is only medium length and the slight ashiness at the end doesn't detract from it at all."
4893,Karuizawa 1992  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,This is very good stuffSpicy and chocolaty with something sweet that I can't identify - molasses perhaps?Floral. Interesting because there are lots of aromas in there that I haven't identified yet.Initially some lemon in here. Then it gets a tang of peat - is this peated? I don't know. Then some creosote - or is it asphalt? I find this quite complex. Hint of ginger that reminds me of NadurraReasonably long and ull of that same creosote/asphalt element.
4894,Karuizawa 1992  Vintage - Single Cask Malt Whisky,"This is SO different from the Scoth single malts whiskies I'm used to. It's a very peculiar whisky with a fantastic nose. A very good and complex whisky, mind you, but there is something 'mysterious' about it.(neat) Sweet alcohol, flowers, fresh fruit (apples?), it's quiet malty. Very soft at this alcohol %. It makes me think of a very full bodied Speysider. (with water) After a few minutes it becomes amazing! I pick up diesel (yes, I do), seaweed, and some peat. I almost don't dare say it but it reminds me of a light version of the Laph 30 (!!!).(neat) Very hot on the tongue! The high alcohol percentage camouflages a lot of flavours. Yet I can pick some peat and some smoke. It's still somewhat sweet with some flowery notes. (with water) Much better! This becomes very complex. Walnuts, some tar. It's strange, but there is something and I just can't put my finger on it. Oh boy, it sticks to my cheeks!Hot (!!), peppery, a bit sweetish, walnuts and just a faint wiff of smoke."

Probably a few more not listed here. Is that virtually none in the context of how many Rouge bottles and Karuizawa bottles there are/were? It's arguable, and personally I think one ought to be careful about telling people categorically they are wrong based on very subtle interpretations of language. However, if I change ""virtually none"" to ""a tiny number"" can we stop this?"

Fortunately the alcohol is accompanied by a big rancio, woody notes, currants, a nice dose of camphor, hazelnut.  With aeration a little exoticism appears, with pineapple and papaya.  It's very fresh. We have a nice bouquet of mint.In the mouth it's a delight.  The fruit is here first.  Then the woody takes over, noble, dusty, round, accompanied by undergrowth, musk.  Then finally reveal aromas of dark chocolate, leather, and slightly of essence.  The dried fruits are picked up and rolled up: hazelnuts, almonds, figs.  You do not smell alcohol at all here.The finish is endless, on papaya, guava, green banana, chocolate, licorice."

4937,Karuizawa 1996  Ghost Series No. 1,"A sample I've had for a long time, offered by a great barman in Japan.  We are pretty far from the prettiest Karuizawa, and far enough from the sherry in my opinion.  But it's still very complex, and it's worth the time to give it some time.  Unfortunately bitterness is too much present.Nose that requires a lot of openness.  A little green for my taste.  Bark of wood, pineapple skin, rhubarb.  We then evolve on white fruits, apple and pear.  Then on herbs, pepper.  A little white chocolate and vanilla complete the whole.  Everything is accompanied by a nice dose of medicinal. Especially camphor.  Suffice to say that the influence of sherry is very discreet.In the mouth, the alcohol is felt. It's damn powerful.  We stay on a similar profile, with mainly white fruit, but also a little yellow fruit (peach syrup) and pineapple.  Aromatic herbs and fresh mint are present.  The woodland is also more present, but is less green than the nose. We have cocoa powder that brings greed and bitterness.  Toffee.Long finish on orange peel, Christmas spices, wood and cocoa powder.  Paradoxically a bit off topic but the best of this glass."
4938,Karuizawa 1996  Ghost Series No. 1,"Not at all convinced by the nose, totally unspecified (but I may have missed it).A nose marked by sherry of course, but it's really nonsense. Aeration of the notes of small red fruits (blackcurrant in particular) appear.There, it is much more interesting. This mouth is very powerful and is marked by aromas of sherry meaty, earthy, almost peaty. It evolves towards cocoa, plastic and a lot of spices. With water, many more spices, and also a metallic side.Long, slightly tannic, on candied fruits and spices including pepper."

We have a good dose of young wood broken in the nose.  Fruit side, we have a little banana.  Aromatic herbs. Mint, rosemary.  A little vanilla and anise. Small side sweet licorice.  A very light peat.  With aeration, the wooded side is used to bring out the vegetal side.  The nose is still quite young.In the mouth it is relatively well integrated.  We have an oily and honeyed mouth.  A little sweet side for coughing.  Here we have a little fruit: pineapple and lemon.  A little ginger. The peaty side seems to have disappeared.The final is a little astregent. On vanilla, bourbon.  Sweet licorice is kept back for a while."

Attack: Like the Hokuto fist's Raoh, strawberry gush is burning sensation. Braised Muette-type eggplant like Grappler Baki's auger. With the passage of time, no harmful phenol is good. The fragrance of the roasted potatoes and the dry feeling of the skin are unbearable. Body: A forceful weight feeling like a West German keeper, appearing in the middle school version of Captain Tsubasa. Taste: The brooms feel great. Strong punishment of aging soup of canned fish. There is no flower, but delicious eringi. It tastes adults too much. Gyo soy sauce Gish than the Kanto ramen! Lucian Gish! But Bitter's best. Truly the Meiwa sliding unit 's bloody fishy smell. It is well-balanced with stone vocabulary and bamboo. No disgusting dark flower. There is also a stuffiness, a strange finger gushes. Do you want to be hit by a cake made with this Karuizawa with drifters' control? You can even feel that way drinking. Finish: Syncope at Assam Bomb of The Gladiator of a supreme old wrestler! Sauce 's yakitori is too sweet to skewers. For chocolate, chocolate is unobtrusive, cacao erupts. Already it does not have to clean even if it spills on the floor? What? Hulk Hogan's Ax Bomber and Neptune Man's Oyazi Gish are attacking at the same time, too luxurious Finish! After all, when I drink such Karuizawa, I think that it was good for Japanese.

4966,Karuizawa 1999  Tokyo International BarShow 2016,"Special thanks to Ady Tay from Malt Haus Penang for this lovely sample.Big and bold, with heavy sherriness up front, as expected - lots of dried fruits like prunes, concentrated marmalade, sticky sweetness that link you to diabetes, punchy overripe fruits. Some nice tobacco leaf, bitter Chinese herbs, fair bit of smokiness with slight bit of coffee in the background. A little mustiness as well. Complex and intriguing.Orange marmalade, resinous sweet fruitiness, dark chocolate, slight bit of sourness and good bitterness to balance the sweetness. Good weight on the palate, with some really punchy dried fruits and oakiness.Long and warm finish, with oranges dominating for me. Some light bitterness towards the end. Simple but enjoyable."

4971,Karuizawa 1999  Memories of Karuizawa no 4,"Totally confusing nose. A malt more curious than excellent. All the same happy to have tasted.By putting your nose on the sample, immediately very precise notes of chicken broth. Very surprising. In the glass, we find them but less precise, less intense. In fact, it pecks a bit: alcohol and pepper. This nose is really very strange. In addition to the chicken broth notes, it reminds me of veal stock, vegetable soup, radish and coffee. In short, confusing!Much more civilized. Especially marked by rancio, nuts and a little toffee and coffee with milk.Very long and very marked by the black pepper of which one would have sketched a grain."

4973,Karuizawa 1999  Noh Whisky,"I am not a big fan of sulfur.  Without that, we would have had something really extra.  We are in sherry which is very compact and powerful in the mouth. A beautiful explosion.  Alcohol is very well integrated.Nose slightly sulfur.  We are on a rather dirty and heavy sherry.  Cherry brandy. Black fruits too ripe.  Caramel, hazelnuts.  A big veil of medicinal. Camphor, eucalyptus. Rubber.  A whole dimension meaty, without being too grilled / smoke. Grison.  Big leather. A little soil.In the mouth, the sulfur is still there.  Leather is also very present.  It's once again very full-bodied and earthy. Mushrooms.  Caffé, dark chocolate.  It's almost a texture level syrup.Final in the continuity of the mouth.  The return of black fruits and cherries."
4974,Karuizawa 1999  Noh Whisky,"Thanks for the sample Steve. Deep rust pour with almost green edges. Crazy nose -- rich fudge, malty dark beer (aged Thomas Hardy's Ale or an old barley wine), melange of dark fruit jams, even earthy with olives and general compost pile funkiness. As it breathes it's more about the heavy sherry and it's a bit more approachable. Not the thickest mouth among Zawas I've had, but certainly intensely potent -- beef stock, dark fudge, marshmallow, loads of old ""wood ear"" mushroom I'm often finding in Zawas. Pretty fascinating! Savory, for sure. So much mushroom in the finish with a pleasant alcohol burn throughout. It lacks the rich body and some integration of the older casks, but it's a cool, crazy one for sure."

4976,Karuizawa 1999  Noh Whisky,"Nose: There's a really charming and medium weight malty fudginess wafting at the forefront. Behind it is a rich smattering of fruit and the faintest wisp of 'dirty sherry' smoke and light sulphur (no match-sticks, folks). Maraschino cherries in liqueur, mango, papaya. Lots of sweet yellow and red tropical fruits, and the savory elements balance out the sweetness very well. It smells thick, sticky, and syrupy. (with water) Water really brings out a melange of fresh and sticky fruit - mango, papaya, pineapple, cherries, you get the idea. Some ashy cigar, smoke, and sandalwood and other softly spiced wood.Palate: Thick, rich, and rather sticky. More savory than the nose would have suggested. Earth behind a softly sulphury sherry (no ham or gunpowder, either). Clay, or something like it. Dry cherry, syrup, and weak ristretto coffee. Really precocious and richly superb. (with water) Some of the fruit is still there at first, but it turns more to chocolate fudgy malt (subtle) that you sometimes get in Karuizawas of this age and vintage, more refined coffee, a sense of umami, a little more dirty sherry, burned cherries in syrup. More oily than sticky syrup. Exceptionally graceful and elegant.Finish: The fine (superb) coffee, light dry sandalwood, earth remain (especially after water), and the sweet fruit essence remains (especially neat). It's intensely sap like, as though a ripe mango and cherries were just oozing nectar. Many of the same fruits as before. It's a champ through and through. I thought about it all day after last night's foray. Cheers to the boys at K&L for this one. It's just the sort of thing that I love in Karuizawa, and here it's done so well. KAMPAI!"

The nose is very dense, very focused on sherry, but not that!  A cocoa effect, dark chocolate, powerful spices such as cinnamon, cumin.  The wood is quite present but not invading, going rather to the side of the worked leather, the cigar box and brown tobacco, a tint lacquered.  And it is in the back of the nose that this Karuizawa makes sense.  Land and fine peat, very slightly smoky but distinctly recognizable, grilled dried fruits, barbecue meat, dried herbs.  The mouth is just as dense, it may be already robust, the oily appearance takes the palate, black cocoa, leather and very spicy tobacco, candied orange chocolate, sweet smoke and toasted / toasted material, fruit shell and structure.  Toasted bread and used wood.  Finale of correct length.  Not crazy, on leather and brown tobacco, licorice, aroma and a very fine bitter yielding Zan.  Vegetal.  I saw him indefensible in the face of the critics who hurried before the Karuizawa effect. But we must not forget that these animals need more time than others to recall.  Perfectly integrated and a nice balance.  He deserves his 90, the price does not fit online rating.  I love Karuizawa, it's far from being the most interesting, but he defends himself.

5039,Karuizawa 29-year-old  The Murasaki Geishas,"The 1980’s was a very rememberable era… The Karuizawa laid down to rest precious spirit which 29 years later became the most recent release in the Geisha series – The Imperial Purple Geisha. The intricate depiction on the front of the bottle represents the hidden beauty of the Maiko on her journey to becoming a Geisha. This echoes the journey of Karuizawa’s whisky, in its recent rise to popularity in becoming one of the most sought-after whiskies in the world after its closure in 2001. The odds of getting your hands on one of these beauties in The Whisky Exchange ballot was very slim due to their limited release of only 60 bottles. It has also been confirmed that one bottle has already been drunk, so we are now down to 59 bottles in the whole world!"

Super concentrated and defined up to the last. Long finish with mineral notes going on and on with those wood and bourbon fruit bitters giving and giving.C: Amazing nose with the clarity on the palate to match.

The taste is dry, tart, and mouth-puckering at first, then turns spicy with lemon pepper, a hint of clove, and touches of linseed oil and licorice that come out as the spices fade along with a touch of molasses. The finish is medium-length, dry, and subtle with hints of licorice, molasses, figs, toffee, and dark chocolate. Outstanding!"

5052,Karuizawa 30-year-old  Geisha labels - Twin Serie,"I found this a good 80's sherry cask Karuizawa - but less intense than others I have tried.  All the elements you expect are there but it was a ""forme fruste"" if you like. Which is actually in some ways quite nice because sometimes you don't need that Karuizawa ""Boom!"" that hits you in the face and blows you away.  This is one for sitting and drinking, reflecting, whiling away some time; it doesn't demand the full on focus and concentration that other bottlings need. The 1981 at the TWE show was indeed one of the aforementioned demanding bottlings. I loved it, but you'd have to spend all your time on it, like a beautiful, vivacious partner who needs all your love and attention to get the most out of the relationship, but which can ultimately prove tiring in the long run if you just want some time to relax and be on your own.  "

5079,Karuizawa Cask Strength  2nd Release,
5080,Karuizawa Cask Strength  2nd Release,"Bottled at cask strength, this bottling is, from start to finish, impressively rich, deep and complex. It begins with revealing an expressive aromatic palate that is never short of things to say. The notes of fruit emerging from the glass are an invitation to begin the tasting immediately, together with what a palate of flavours it delivers.The initial nose reveals dark fruit notes of plum, prune, date and raisin that burst and deliver a sweet and divine nectar. Then, it opens onto citrus fruits (orange, tangerine, mandarin), rhubarb and dark chocolate. Into second sniff, the nose is now wrapping in a thick layer of spices before it gradually receiving a more vanilla, hints of smoke and creamy consistency of salted butter caramel. Charming heady floral notes infuse the atmosphere whilst the Golden Promise malted barley unfold the attractive and strong character of the candied fruits of lemon and pear. Allowed it to breath and with drops of water, the nose softly opens onto red fruits (redcurrant, strawberry, raspberry) whilst noble spices (cumin, clove, cardamom) shape its contours. Its rich personality is prolonged with dark chocolate and salted butter.Velvety on arrival. Fruitiness takes the center stage. A basket of red, dark and citrus fruits placed on a recently waxed wooden table to form the foundations. Blackcurrant, cherry, porched peach, lemon, plum, apricot, banana, mango, passion fruit and a few oranges make an appearance. To their side, come waxy notes, oaky, dark chocolate and roasted coffee. As with the nose, the sherry also leaves its mark of delicious palate. With water, it lingers with notes of oily, more savoury and malty. The end of the palate is extremely rich and the ripe fruits hardly have time to emerge that they are already joined by a lot of plums, oranges and mangoes.Medium long. As predictable at the end of palate, red and black fruits arrive in a mass multitude which also lingers with the notes of mushroom and dried leaf. Spices of cardamom, cumin and cinnamon providing the tail end of the palate with a noble temptation. Retro nasal highlights the fullness of its flavours. Empty glass burst with chocolate chips, salted butter and hints of smoke."

5087,Karuizawa Multi-Vintages #1  Noh Whisky,"Karuizawa Multi-Vintage # 1  Awesome I hold the small sample bottle in hand, on his label is written by hand: Karuizawa 27y Multi-Vintage. My heart beats faster, the pulse is faster, I look forward to my first Karu!  I gently open the small vial, carefully pour the contents into my Premium Snifter. Rusty brown and deep amber with a reddish glow shines the Karu in the glass. Majestically, after swirling, oily drops dissolve out of the streaks adhering to the glass wall and search their way back into the glass in slow motion.  I close my eyes. In the time-lapse, the years fly past me and finally I am shrouded in fog at the beginning of the 80's in the middle of the Karuizawa Distillery in far-off Japan. The sun is high on the horizon a fresh pinch blows over the yard. I take a deep breath and perceive the different scents.  (Nose) From the whisky casks standing in the yard, a spicy and fruity woody aroma rises. Old wood elements mix with sweet berries and ripe fruits. A dark and dry berry aroma blows in my direction and exudes its wonderfully soft and fresh aroma. Dried berries pickled in rum are voluminous, and a hint of old and ripe oranges rises into the nose. The plum and cherry trees on the grounds exude their wonderfully fruity and intense aroma, nearby a few bushes of fresh mint and peppermint smell. A pleasant alcohol note lies over the whole complex and reminds me of where I am right now, a whisky distillery! I go a few steps further. The dry ground dust, mineral and slightly salty aromas whirl up. From a warehouse wet leather flavors and a touch of cold tobacco. A moment later, the mint releases again its fruity and fresh aroma. I take a deep breath several times and can not satiate with the intense and beguiling aromas!  (Taste) Suddenly an old man comes out of a warehouse, comes up to me and hands me a glass of whisky. I am curiously nipping the glass. Dark fruit flavors spread softly and velvet over the tongue, then the malt explodes in my mouth. Wow, what a kick! Spicy and dark wood notes hit hard on my palate, wooden sharpness and a pinch of chilli make the mouth glow briefly. Slowly the heat fades away, dried dates and raisins follow and exude their fruity and creamy aroma in the entire mouth. Tart wood and fruit notes appear, discreetly bitter leather flavors mingle with a few old tobacco crumbs. The harsh and dry woody aromas now dominate the flavor until suddenly unexpectedly creamy and sweet aromas rise from the wood. The old tobacco leaves become more intense, the leather flavor returns. Mint and freshness dissolve from the leather-tobacco mixture and a voluminous, powerful aroma makes the taste slowly pass into the finish.  (Departure) Dreamily, I look up and hold the empty glass in my hand. Dark and dry tobacco aromas remind me of the great and delicate taste. Tart and dry notes of wood remain in the memory for a long time, creamy, dark fruit flavors return, plums and berries flash briefly again. The tart and creamy mouthfeel lasts for a long time, the complete flavors of the taste return briefly again. A touch of leather, fresh mint and a hint of eucalyptus, old and dried tobacco leaves, berries and prunes. Spicy and tart wood aromas with a fine hint of mint finish the finish slowly and make me rave about this great taste experience.  Gradually the pictures fade in my head, I open my eyes slowly and find myself in the present again. One last time smell into the empty snifter glass, absorb the remaining flavors and thank ASWhisky for the gigantic sample and the wonderful trip to far away Japan!  (Conclusion) What a taste experience! A truly old and multi-layered whisky. My first karu and hopefully not my last. The variety of different and beguiling aromas still make me swarm. As I write these lines, a dreamy mix of dried tobacco leaves and fresh mint returns. From the empty Nosingglas still raise intense aromas. After this incredible taste experience and my journey to the land of the rising sun, I have no choice but to end my tasting with the following words ...  yes, I'm in heaven  AS, thank you for this wonderful Karu!"

Scotch whisky that is aged is far too expensive now but when compared to the absurd prices of Japanese whisky they start to become an attractive proposition."
5093,Karuizawa Multi-Vintages #1  Noh Whisky,"Tasted with a few drops of water.Masses of dark fruits mixed with some red fruits on the nose, this has some depth to it for sure.Again like the 1981 cask 155 it reminds me of a bourbon.Not as spicy as other KZ but the balance is good.The spice note grows as you go on, with a red gooseberry note and ever so slightly sour red plum but that is not a problem.The spice just keeps growing and the finish is long because the spice note does not fade which is a big plus.This is more evenly balanced than most of the single casks I have tasted from this distillery,perhaps a vatting of casks best illustrates the plus points of the Karuizawa distillate?"

Perhaps even some gran marnier and gorgeous seville oranges. Almost reminds me, at points, of some of my favorite baco Armagnacs. Hooray! (with water) Rather more elegant, with greater emphasis on light extracted fruit and honey. Demerara rum and syrup.Palate: All that was on the nose, this baby delivers. Orange, chocolate, figs, salted bacon grease (yum), wood, vanilla, and date extract. Elegant and powerful. (with water) brilliant. I love this without water, but with water... speechless.Finish: Thick and chewy, just a delight. I forgot to put a score on this; my final note was, as written: BUY A BOTTLE OR MORE. Check. So, I'm going to have to say that this was somewhere between an A and an A+. Marvelous stuff and just what I want. For the sake of being absolutely arbitrary, I'm just going to give this a 97."

Patient needed for it to open up, otherwise it just smells like cabbage soaked water. 20 minutes probably best or risk of letting the thin aroma dissipated to the air, if longer. Little leather, red fruits with sweaty and musky wood struggling to come thru, too young and probably over diluted.P- Sweet and fairly light with some wood ash, suppressed and ordinary.F- Light and short, forget about body and texture, with some mint and spicy coat.Another rather anti-climax dram with over the moon big price tag. — at The Whisky Bar, Kuala Lumpur."

I let him stand and breathe, sometimes it disappears with a little more air. A little better, now all sorts of herbs I like. If only it weren't for the annoying sulfur. Otherwise there isn't much going on in the nose. Very herbaceous in the mouth, slight bitterness from the wood. Toffiffee. The sulfur is still getting through too much for me, match alarm. Otherwise I won't taste much more. Complexity nil. I think he would surely find his fans with other numbers on the price tag, For me that's ok, but nothing more."

Somewhat old-style flavour wise with vibrancy. The next day the nose is fully fungal with ginger, soy,…, it’s a proper oriental dish.T: Ok, yeah - that's nice. Stands out clearly from the five other sherried whiskies i’ve tried tonight with deep sherry notes that sit in-between the rubbery Glenrothes and the grainy Glendronach 15 Revival - but yet with a deeper, richer and denser oriental sherry style.F: Rubbery sherry, shoe polish, cognac, gunpowder sulphur,…C: Yes, I know it's one of god's gifts and everything and it’s very good but of course it’s not perfect. There’s plenty of complexity on the nose and it tastes fab, but the resulting finish is,...  a little too much sherry influence - an influence that seems to mask the underlying spirit somewhat.

Huge vanilla and bitter<sweet with significantly less sherry influence here compared to the trifle monster on the nose. Short but marvelous full on development with a very fine mouthfeel indeed.F: Salty light aniseed finish that goes from bitter to sweet in a flash with a sour edge. Seemingly short finish at first with those vanillas hanging on by fingertips but actually theres a rather more complex lingering for the toffee/fudge malt coupled with that bitter to sweet interplay.C: Powerhouse malt with a glistening controlled performance all the way through.

5151,Corner Creek Reserve,"In the last 10 years I have bought a bottle again and again - often the unbeatable 1.75 liters for around € 60. Corner Creek is a decent middle class bourbon, more on the spicy than on the sweet side, with nice malt and an elegant barrel note. There are neither glue nor other wrong notes, the drinking strength is wonderful, dangerously tasty. For me a nice digestif. And - someone already wrote this - somehow close to middle-aged Armagnacs. The only drawback, it remains in the dark what is actually in the bottle, both in terms of the distillery and the age. But that applies to many of the bourbons from Frankfort, which are not so common."
5152,Corner Creek Reserve,"Corner Creek Reserve Bourbon 44%. 25ml at home, June/July 2021.Very amber orange in appearance. A touch empty and one-dimensional on the nose. Char, uncooked corn, margarine, cooking oil, plasticine. Taste is citrussy up front for sure, a bit spiritous and bitter. Thin with bitter oak and not too much of the 'sweet' character I really expect from bourbon. Burnt orange peel. Bitter char and some slightly acrid floral notes, spicy linger. I’m guessing there’s a fair amount of rye, which can be great – but it depends. It’s just not coming together that well, something is jarring. I had read some good reviews and I was hoping to agree with them … but this is a pretty below-average flavour profile for me unfortunately. 2.9/70"

This would be a nice Bourbon to take to a party and impress your friends."
5166,Johnny Drum Green Label  Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey,"I bought this as a treat to myself. A nice Bourbon at a cheap price.This has a really strong nose for a 40% vol. people were walking in the room and they could smell it in the air. Bubblegum, felt tip pen, Banana and red cherry dance around the nostrils. It has quite a light and refreshing taste to it with summer fruit pudding, ginger cake, molasses and Dyme bar.A medium sweet black forest fruit finish."
5167,Johnny Drum Private Stock,"A different and complex Bourbon, a little water is recommended, it takes the edge off and really opens it up. Recommended for the advanced Bourbon drinker who looks for something a bit off mainstream. Would've scored a few points higher if it wasn't for this occasionally recurring cardboardy note when undiluted, although I definitely have to assure you this surely won't be the last bottle I bought.prickly pear, bay leaf, pimento, black olives, gourmet paprika, dried cranberries, rhubarb-gooseberry lemonade, mint, amarena cherry, after a while heather honey develops. Without the addition of water, there can be a hint of cardboard occasionally. Overall, the nose is juicy/fruity/red and dry/herbal/green at the same time.a big sweet and sour arrival, luscious, prickly pear juice, red currant candy, a little juniper, cough sweets, herb lemonade (Almdudler), rosewater, elder flower, cherry candy, mint, a fruity curry with a salty edge, it's bold, deep, and well balanced, but not heavy or oily. As far as the taste in general is concerned, for a Bourbon, this tends way more towards 'dry' than 'sweet'.coconut grates with black olives, herb lemonade (Almdudler), rosewater, eucalyptus, some thyme, candy sugar, medium length."

5169,Johnny Drum Private Stock,"This was a sample courtesy of lincolnimp  Strong Oak on the nose, plastic sheeting, red cherry, marshmallow, peach, passion fruit, stewed apple and parma violet sweets. This was quite bland and I really struggled with it so I added water, what have I got to lose and it really opened it up as the nose suggests above. It's not as dry and a lot sweeter. Vanilla, canned fruit and fruit nougat. Just a couple of drops does it. Quite a long finish with dry banana and liquorice on the death. "

5191,Kentucky Vintage Small Batch Bourbon  Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey,"Kentucky Vintage KSB 45%. Consumed Oct 2021.Pale amber. Aroma up-front is sawdust, papery, dried apple peel devoid of sugars, something like celery and cardamom. Given 5 minutes in the glass it broadens out and becomes ‘sweeter'. Pale wood is complemented by white sugar syrup, hint of menthol and white pepper. Interesting enough nose. A wait after pouring helped it. Taste is wood- and spice-forward, backed up by light touches of orange and toffee, plenty of clove throughout and some literal woodiness. Dry, spicy, boozy with woody flavours. Finishes relatively short but then you taste it again on the next exhale. It’s well balanced and bottled at a good abv for the spirit. I generally prefer a higher abv of around 50% for bourbon but this one would probably be too spiky at 50%. Leans slightly towards dry booziness rather than sweet impressions. I like this although it doesn’t have the type of profile that I’d like to drink regularly, meaning I wouldn’t personally commit to a bottle. It's a solid bourbon without a doubt though, and one that kept growing on me. You could do worse than this in paying £45 for a bourbon. 3.5/84"

With half a teaspoon of water at one dram you can really get something out of him.Burnt caramel, candied fruits, roasted almonds and marzipan, with bay leaves, chervil, oregano. Tobacco leaves, leather. Very pleasant: no glue note at all! 88Starts with a very nice spicy creaminess, in which toasted bread slices, burnt caramel, marzipan and some pepper can be found. Tart herbs lay on candied fruits, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate for men.Lasts a long time.

5198,Noah's Mill Genuine Bourbon Whiskey  Small Batch Bourbon,"Uncomplicated, enjoyable bourbon. I think its strong point is its high strength, thanks to which the “standard” set of taste and aroma characteristics for most bourbons is perceived by the receptors much more interestingly.Ripe yellow pear, pickled apples, a little brine and varnish shades, cinnamon, warm pastries.Paprika, black pepper, oak bitterness, a little dill, strong black tea.In general, it duplicates aroma and taste."
5199,Noah's Mill Genuine Bourbon Whiskey  Small Batch Bourbon,"Noah’s Mill 57.15%.3cl sample at home, Sep 2021.A dull, light-amber orangeAroma is ‘hot’ spiritous alcohol and resin up front, stinging the nose a bit to start. With air this settles down quickly – char, burnt petals, vaguely chocolatey, waxy orange peel. Not deep caramelised notes at all. Almost savoury in some ways – like seared chicken strips in a thin salsa. It reminds me a lot of Wild Turkey on the nose.Taste is surprisingly easy on the palate. Wow. This is 57%? No burn, hardly any alcohol showing up. Rich and dense. Thick ‘sweet’ impressions of orange and syrup, with drier floral and spicy rye and oak bringing up later, bringing a waxiness. Just the slightest ‘green-ness’ of rye – nothing distracting at all.Usually when I drink a high ABV (55% plus) bourbon I think, ‘Why? What’s the point?’. Not here. This carries its high strength as well as any other whiskey on the planet. This drinks beautifully at the ABV – I’m not sure I’ve had many whiskies that carry their strength more impressively.It’s one of those bourbons with balance between spice and sweet, which isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. Personally I prefer just a little less of the spice edge, but there’s no doubt this is good stuff. The price, at £70, is okay. Not a bargain, not extortionate. Just relatively fair for the quality. Compared to the price slapped on so many bourbons, it’s a relative bargain I suppose. 3.6/86With a small drop of water and a wait: Possibly better depth on the palate. The loss of spiciness creates an impression of more ‘sweetness’, despite the loss in richness and density of flavour. Lots more char. Even more waxiness. The spice and ‘green-ness’ have subsided. The flavours are less focused on one point of attack and there’s a much better finish. Drinkability accelerates dangerously. I enjoy this about the same with and without a drop of water, but for different reasons. 3.6/86"
5200,Noah's Mill Genuine Bourbon Whiskey  Small Batch Bourbon,"This is one heavy duty bourbon! It is wonderful - if you like it dirty in a good way.

Almost like a splash of water from a rocky beach on a lake shore. Vanilla extract.

Wonderful.A lovely strong Oakwood nose is the first thing that hits, but coming up behind are some wonderful fruits like cherry and plum. The vanilla is there as with all bourbons and a large dollop of chocolate orange.Thick and chewy when you swill it around your mouth, and it leaves that nice warm coating that is just heaven. Quite smooth for a bourbon, full bodied and you can taste the wood and dates as it warms your soul.A long mouth coating, fruity. dry finish that lasts long into the night if you have a nip before you go to bed.

Relatively light and sweet and no smell of fruit. But also no eagle owl. It becomes sweet with water, with a hint of pine needles.very strong. Cask strength or something.

5210,Noah's Mill Genuine Bourbon Whiskey  Small Batch Bourbon,"I seem to be one of the few who do not find this bourbon awesome. For me it is too complicated and too edgy. It is too bottled for my taste, but hardly tolerates water. Before you know it, he tilts into insignificance. Undiluted, he comes with a strong herbal / Bittermandelnote therefore (from Rye?), Which one must like. This note pushes up my bile. Who likes this taste, will find the whiskey certainly interesting and complex. I can not help but suspect a hype for an actually unbalanced drink."
5211,Noah's Mill Genuine Bourbon Whiskey  Small Batch Bourbon,"I don’t know it with this one. I tend to find it a little bit to heavily bodied on the nose.

But objectively speaking it is complex and it really has it’s own character. Not your typical, average Bourbon.Full flavoured, silky and intens. Caramel, sweet corn, complex spices. Nutty and Bread. Needs quite a lot of water before i find it drinkable. Well i have to say on the taste this is a real treat!A bit onesided and the usual suspects. No suprises here."

Give this a few minutes to breathe and you'll be rewarded with a beautyful thick refined dry fruit nose (add some water* and you'll be able to smell this baby for real). Also there are wood and caramel notes plus a hint of tortilla chips. Honeydew melon after a few sips. Something nutty too.Initial taste and palate fulfill what the nose promises: Pleasant brown sugar and honey, a mixture of dried figs, plums and apricots, pineapple. Very chewy must I add. Cocoa emerging towards the end.The finish is quite short. Only vague memories flare up on the tongue and the palate, just to be completely gone the very next second. Almost magic how you really have to use your imagination to find the cocoa sprinkled chocolate pudding there.Pricewise this will be a snap buy should I ever encounter it again**. Presentation lies somewhere in between country (the label) and luxury (bottle, seal), +1 for the blue wax.*This bourbon can take a lot of water, I'd suggest you gradually add small amounts and observe how this whiskey evolves along the way.**I reviewed batch QBC No. 10-49."

This is one of those examples I’ve always wanted to try but it never came to buying a bottle. I have quite some expectations so let’s have a look.Wow okay this is different stuff! Rye is the first thing that comes to me. But also unusual flavors I do not often get in bourbon like dark chocolate, raisins and leather. Also vanilla is very present.On the palate it is silky en tremendously gentle! Probably one of the most silky bourbon’s I’ve ever had. After a while more peppery flavors appear but in a mild way tingling the front and middle of the tongue.In the finish again quite some rye influence. It is pretty damn competitive to all those classic bourbon flavors which really makes this a joy to drink. I get hints of vanilla and honey (quite standard and predictable) but also I get leather, shoe polish and some sort of industrial glue.Overall the Woodford and Eagle Rare were quite a surprise but I have to conclude that, with the FR single barrel and this Rowan’s creek bourbon, I did save the best for last in this 8 bourbon try out."
5224,Rowan's Creek Straight Kentucky Bourbon,"Nicely balanced bourbon, with some typical sweet notes and some glue and petrol-like notes. At first, the finish appears to be somewhat short, but after some time it gets much longer and better.Very sweet, vanilla, sweet corn, with also a whiff of glue and some petrol-like scent. Pretty some alcohol. Later on some sawdust.Pretty full body, without being too stinging from alcohol, pretty smooth actually. Thick structure, oily, some petrol again. Sweet, corn, vanilla, glue.Still powerful, sweet corn with now some bitter notes, and grassy. Middle long, although later on, sweet notes remain pretty long, with also some fresh wood."

5235,Rowan's Creek Straight Kentucky Bourbon,"Rowans Creek 50.1%. Consumed Oct 2019. All the entries on WB are 50.5%, but this says 50.1%. Aroma is certainly oaky in a slightly mousy toffeeish kind of way with lots of crystalline 'sweet food' essences suggesting honey and ginger. Doesn't quite have the standard vanilla-coconut thing going on. Taste is certainly firey - there's a cinnamony boozy punch, salt and cinnamon firewater, drinks even a touch higher than the actual ABV with a little gingery note coming through like in the aroma. Certainly not a beginner's whiskey. A touch brash on the oak and the heat. Favours being big over being complex. Fun but not really my king of thing. Quite astringent tannic oak on the linger with a faint but building soapy vibe. I completely understand why people like it but it's a bit middle of the road for me 3.0/72"

Vanilla, obviously and some fruit, mostly citric but some pineapple and a hint of kiwi as well. A little bit ryeish first but gives way to more a Bourbon like nose, just give it some time. Not very complex but nice enough, needs time to open up. Oh wait, water makes it more fun!The higher strength can be felt on the tongue, some sweetness and fruit there, but in quite a modern way. I really had to take some time with this, first impression was this is kind of boring stuff but it´s getting better... Good thing they didn´t bottle this at 40 %, but on the other hand water interestingly helps this Bourbon a lot and just pronounces all of the above in a good way, even adds some Marzipanness (is this a word?) and the taste of cheap honey cake from your discounter.Quite on the weak side, some sweetness still there and the corn popping up but not very much going on here."

5253,Vintage Bourbon 17-year-old,"I understand why this whiskey has become so expensive. It's big, fruit and complex. No clue from which distillery this (KBD?) sourced whiskey is. Many thanks for the sample Rob!Rich aroma with lots of rye spices and hints of mint-toffee. Fresh pencil shaving. Cedar wood. Vanilla. Cigar boxes. Some earthy notes. Pine. Very promising.Firm and robust. Ripe dark fruits of blackberry and plums. Also strawberries. Thick layers of wild honey and roasted chestnuts. Cumin. Balanced spicy oak. Quite complex.Long. Spiced rum. Cinnamon and aniseed. A little pepper. Spearmint."

5256,Vintage Bourbon 17-year-old,I had this in 2008-2009 + - and it was a nasty rye. From my understanding somewhere around that time frame the bottlers switched from rye to a very nice wheater. Apparently just the font on the back label and the juice changed. Now I hear the they have depleted the wheated juice they have been using the last few years. I think it is has been a great whiskey over the last few years and bunkered what I could.

The whiskey has been aged for 3 years in virgin American white oak casks. For the age, this whiskey is simply superb!Sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and slight chili. These give way to a menthol-led herbaceous quality, shortly flowed by a wave of citrus rind and orchard fruit aromas.Rye spices, a touch of mint, followed by a more intense, corn-led caramel and toffee flavour. These notes are accompanied by a bright oak and milk chocolate flavour which leads nicely into the finish.Long with plenty of rye spice, a little oak and more of that milk chocolate, drying slightly with time."

5272,Willett 03-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Small Batch Rye,"I found it delicious and infinitely tasty!Blind tasting:  Colour:  Dark gold with a slight reddish tinge  Nose:  First comes a clean glue note. Is not meant to be derogatory. Then comes vanilla and slightly sour fruit sweetness. The colleague smells already set and mature. The alcohol does not stand out, but is very pleasant. Smells something like rosé wine.  With a little more time in the glass, it gets sweet. With some peppermint and cereals. A juicy, ripe orange opens up. Just like a trail of caraway. Marzipan and chocolate. This nose I find very interesting and somehow cool.Soft, fruity onset. Then slightly sour plum with sugar. Herbal tea and some cumin, also in the taste. Orange, mirabelle, almonds and dark chocolate. Reminds me of noble drops in nut chocolates. But the taste has something very own, atypical. But also brutally tasty tasty.Long and spicy. Juniper?!, Cereals and raisins. But then it is replaced by a sweet teen."
5273,Willett 03-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Small Batch Rye,"First of all a lot of fruit in the nose, almost tropical, hardly any oak, more vanilla, pepper and a lot of mint, almost chewing gum-like. Although not stinging with 55% at the start. With time more oak and also slightly bready notes.  Mouth: here are the 55% then felt. Very spicy, lots of pepper, mint and here also neat portion of oak, a slightly acidic bread note, plus a nice bitterness, which pulls over into the finish, which then on oak, mint and a pack of gummy bears (ie the aftertaste) gets stuck ,  This one is so different from the first two today and somehow more that I imagine and expect under a rye. In particular, the mint notes are only weak to hear in the first two."
5274,Willett 04-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Rye,"Pours medium orange copper.  Nose is heavy on candied orange peel, cloves and other spices, Christmas like, quite fruit cake like.  Of course alcohol burn.  Mouth again heavy on these cloves and orange peel, soaked in brandy of course, light fruit cake.  As the bottle opens up the flavor become more green and less mature.  Almost vodka-like at times, very green and I do prefer ryes older and darker than this."

5276,Willett 04-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Rye,"my first Rye and it tastes very good! However for me rye freshman and bourbon layman to beginners smells and tastes very similar to a bourbon. Caramel, vanilla, sweet honey each full roar, with tobacco notes and some pepper and nutmeg in the mouth. However, zero solvent or adhesive note as I often find in Bourbons times. And of the fact that 55%, you notice nothing. Nice and gentle on the nose. Creamy and spicy in the mouth and no trace of alcohol here."

I was allowed to rehearse once and he is still good, but maybe not as outstanding as the first time. Since I have a form today, the rather unspirited notes remain standing next to the top rating.

That's what a Rye should be like!Rich, full flavors right at the beginning, caramel, herbs, the alcohol cools the nose a bit, but it is not unpleasant, no aldehyde. Within a short time harmonize the aromas, the slightly acidic barrel notes are added, pannacotta, roasted aromas, fruit cake, nothing stands out uncomfortable, everything is beautifully interwoven. Warms up incredibly powerful with slight emphasis on the wood notes.A revelation, sweet, tough, oily, perfect in balance, this Rye shows itself with sheer brute force, without even burning in the beginning. Caramel, herbs, barrel flavors, everything is there. Yeah, that's it!In the finish nothing that would stand out, the flavors go smoothly, a fine tart nuttiness remains at the end even quite a long time in the mouth."

The alcohol is wonderfully integrated, amazing for the age !!!  In the mouth a bit one-dimensional, but nice. Light rye seasoning, again wonderful fresh mint and now some orange oil.  The freshness changes into a long, warming finish. There are some kräutrige flavors back.  Exciting drop, in Europe unfortunately usually relatively expensive.

5287,Willett 09-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"A good bourbon, done well. Nothing jumps out at me though, and so does not deserve a 90 points.

I tasted this side by side with http://www.whiskeybase.com/whiskies/whiskey/98165/oldfangled-knotter-bourbon-10-year-old. The Oldfangled cost me around $100. I get the same satisfaction. Despite the rather strong ABV, there is no alcoholic sting at all. Subtle nose, actually. Sweet, cinnamon, allspice.Ahhh, now we know this is a strong whiskey.

No water needed with this one, but a few drops won't hurt that much. Lots of unique little flavors that is not found in regular Willetts, much less your run-of-the-mill bourbons. Explosive. Lots of butterscotch and creamy vanilla. No wonder this particular 11yo McScrooge has quite a reputation in bourbon circles. Very expensive nowadays."

5296,Willett 13-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"It's a good willett, but not something I would want to seek out, especially at secondary prices. The biggest problems with this is that it's a bit thin and the finish a bit flat. Nothing special. Still, a good bourbon. I would value this at $100USD, taste-wise. But because it's wax and it's bonili, this would command a premium. "
5297,Willett 14-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"Another very good Willett, yet not very unique... I am giving it 89-90 points again. 14 year is quite old for a Willett bourbon and it commands a good secondary price, but in this case, as compared to a 10-12 year old one, I would not pay up to get a 14 yo.

I am tempted to give this below 90 points, but I will be generous.Obviously wheated -- caramel, lots of cinnamon, dark dried fruits. A very nice nose.Very oaky, but only for oaky sake. Not very complex for 20something year old wheated barrel. What, short finish?!? Seriously, this is the shortest finish ever for a brown spirit that is tagged as 68.4%. Usually, at the very least, the oak and spice would last a while, but this one just dies off... Disappointing for a well-aged C barrel. "

These 20-something year old Willett wheaters are all very expensive, but they add years to your life!!! With that said, they do not deserve more than $500 of your money (as of early 2018) instead of multiples of that. Immediately high quality. A wonderful bourbon nose, which I'll be honest, is less exciting than a wonderful single malt nose. However, I've drank enough bourbon to know that this really excellent. Caramel, cinnamon, nice sweetness, with just the right amount of dried fruits. This is wheated by the way. Concentrated, quite complex, slightly drying, but it is quite balanced overall for a 22 year old bourbon. Definitely oaky (really?) at first taste, but boy, for a regular bourbon drinker like myself, it's almost heaven. Long, long, long. Very nice. The problem with all these aged Willetts is that we know they are all DAMN GOOD. Period. "

5311,Willett Pot Still Reserve  94 proof - Glass decanter,"A few weeks ago I was able to taste a dram of this Kentucky Bourbon and was pleasantly surprised. In spite of the advanced hour, the drop mouthed and could still provoke delight. It wasn't just the dark, mahogany appearance in the glass ...Somewhat reserved at the beginning, a nice nose develops over time, characterized by dried apricots, light chocolate, molasses and sandalwood. Everything looks very lush and soft, but without being intrusive or fake.The bourbon then develops its full strength on the palate, sweet, oily and lush with full fruit. It almost looks a little scented, but ripe apricots, cooked plums, sandalwood and vanilla are real seductions. Light spice notes round off the overall picture and let it appear smooth and soft on the tongue.The finish is rather medium-length, you first feel a slight sharpness on the palate, which seems to dry up for a short moment, before the aromas of dried fruit take over softly and wastefully."

A toasted cereal note beautifully integrated.  With water (1 full teaspoon) : the aroma is calmer, rounder, warmer. However, no new aromas are added, but the smell is more balanced and pleasant in the nose. Also, no flavors are lost by adding water. After 1 sip clearly Butterscotch.very sweet and slightly sour. Velvety and buttery. Honey, caramel toffee, butterscotch. Again, a rye cereal note.clearly toffee (explosive), vanilla, honey. Medium-length finish. At the end just a bit sour-bitter on the palate."

5317,Willett Pot Still Reserve  94 proof - Glass decanter,"Sweet OakI recently tried the Kentucky Vintage, the entry level bourbon from this producer. This Willett’s Pot Still Reserve is said to be at the other end of the spectrum. It is, as stated by both the name and the packaging, not just distilled in a column still, but also – in the doubler stage – in a pot still. It is very clear.The nose is almost complex. There is a lot going on. The emphasis is on citrus with lime and oranges, but also some vanilla, a bit of caramel and a nice hint of potpourri. Plums? Sweet oak, should such a thing exsist. It is mouth coating and piquant. The spices clamor for attention for quite a while, before allowing the sweetness to show itself. Think vanilla and caramel, but also Cuberdons (Google it!).The finish is rather short. The spices are spent, making the finish very soft and sweet.Lovely bourbon, but apparently not easy to find. Looks good in the cabinet, though."
5318,Willett Pot Still Reserve  94 proof - Glass decanter,"Not the best bourbon I've ever had, but they are always nice.Smoky orange toffee. Doesn't seem heavy on the rye, maybe well wheated.

It's bright, yet restrained. There is a boatload of rye spice. A little varnish and coffee. Spicy indeed. Coconut and rye mint. This keeps evolving, constantly changing, always rich, layered, and superb. (w/water) No real difference; maybe the flavors are loosened up a bit and the dry chocolate is highlighted.Rich, dense, and explosively powerful rye. Chocolate and fresh sweet-and-tart orange. Maple and caramel. Just a perfect amount of extremely well integrated wood. Burned fruit cake with burnt maraschino cherries. Lots of layers. (with water) Simplifies to chocolate and heavy rye, but it loses depth and complexity.Extraordinary. Easily one of the best bourbons that I've had so far. This is what an old high-rye bourbon should aspire to be. Rich, syrupy, dense. Awesome. I'd love to get my hands on more!"

A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT!Orange flavors with light tones of rye and oak underneath. Marmalade, spicy, orange peel, menthol, eucalyptus.Orange is still dominant. Further tones of molasses sugar, fresh wood, allspice, pepper and rye. A balanced mix of citrus and rye.First young rye, nuts, pepper. Then leathery and wood."

5334,Kilchoman 100% Islay  The 10th Edition,"While last year's edition was a pure bourbon barrel filling with 1st fill and refill bourbon barrels, this year there are 39 bourbon barrels as well as 2 Oloroso sherry butts in Vatting - 11 barrels more than in 2018, where 23 bourbon barrels and 7 Oloroso butts were used.  I really liked the pure bourbon cask maturation from last year, the bourbon / sherry mix from the previous year a little less, so I was curious to see whether the two sherry casks in Vatting really make themselves felt - and if so Yes how.  Well then, the sherry barrels (maybe) had a hint in their nose. There were hints of raisins and dried figs, which were not very pronounced - which I personally welcome, because Kilchoman from the (pure) bourbon barrel is a combination that basically never leads to bad or even mediocre results.The smoky note is not intense, but still clearly visible. Freshly mown meadow, lemon juice, warm tray. Raisins and dried figs? Maybe. There is something that wants to come forward but cannot prevail.  A herbal, spicy note swings underground from the start, which initially reminds of juniper berries and then moves towards bay leaves and allspice.Dry and strong start, which immediately comes up with intense chocolate notes, herbs, honey and a warm tin roof. Cold, ashy smoke from a campfire, lemon wedges impaled over the fire to dry. Black tea, hayloft, vanilla, forest honey. Increasingly seasoning, it becomes pepperier, more intense, also with regard to the smoke.Medium-long, dry and intensely smoky finish. Malt, honey, vanilla, toffee, cold coffee."
5335,Kilchoman 100% Islay  The 10th Edition,"Quite different from Batch 9 from 2019 - not quite as deep and pleasing but all the more intense and edgy. The sherry barrels add flavor and variety. Nevertheless, I liked the previous bottling, which was made entirely from bourbon barrels, a tad better.Surprisingly clear smoke, a slight smoked bacon note and some prunes (the sherry is subtle but clearly noticeable despite the small amount), but a somewhat flowery, sweet note of cereals and citrus fruits is dominant, along with dried garden herbs and a bit of bitterness from the oak. After the first sip, the grain turns a little into malt coffee. Intense but quite simple nose that brings exactly what you can expect from paper.Now you notice the 50%. The smoke will now be warm and slightly ashy. Again lots of fresh grain and lemon peel. Vanilla and cold herbal tea sweetened with honey. Already a touch of chocolate and the oak is already knocking. That adds a little spice to the already intense taste.Mhh what a nice finish. Warming smoke, dry sweetness, malt and bitter herbs as well as pleasant wood and a hint of coffee-chocolate confectionery. Unfortunately only a little over medium in length."
5336,Kilchoman 100% Islay  The 10th Edition,"N : shy at first, on mineral peat, lemon peel, a touch of plums and custard. It grows quite fresh and fruity, plums but also raisins. Ginger. There's still some kind of hard edge to it, a metallic note. It's a nice nose, sadly too thin for me.M : peatier and definitely less fruits there. Hay, bitter, cold cigarette.F : After a rounder, nutty instant, cold coffee and cigarettes is what remains, with the bitterness.I think I'm looking for more body than this, on that aspect I think Port Charlotte Islay Barley does better. Shame that I didn't find the fruits from the nose elsewhere. 5/10"

5339,Kilchoman 100% Islay  The 10th Edition,"The annual batch 100% Islay from Kilchoman Distillery is a special bottling. Kilchoman is a farm distillery and is located on Rockside Farm on the Rhinns of Islay, the headland in the north-west of the island. The grain from this farm can also be found in the batches of the Islay Barley bottling from Bruichladdich. In the meantime, it should mainly end up in Kilchoman's whiskys. For the 10th edition, mainly bourbon barrels were married with a small amount of sherry (39 bourbon barrels and 2 sherry butts). That makes a straw yellow whisky. www.glen-efze.deIn the nosing, the smoke is strongly present without stinking. The notes are ashy, but there is also some smoke blowing from the fireplace. This is followed by citrus fruits, grated grapefruit peel with a bitter-fruity aroma. The smoke has a subtle maritime rinsing edge character.The taste of the whisky is robust, the alcohol pushes the aromas, but does not burn. There is hardly any sweetness, the whisky is dry and has more herbs and straw than fruit. And smoke that covers the mouth, dry and ashy, with the smoke of simmering seaweed.Woody notes remain in the aftertaste, but above all the smoke in the mouth. This is how you imagine an Islay whisky from a farm distillery. Strong smoky, robust with maritime notes, herbs and straw. This is a rough Islay whisky with some rough edges that goes well with a windy day on the farm."

The subtle, but constantly present peat smoke harmonizes wonderfully with the overall package."
5344,Kilchoman Loch Gorm  2021 Edition,"A solid sherry smokey whisky from a drinkers PoVThis is no sherry bomb and an okay balance - the smoke appears shortly after the sherry. Quality sherry casks used but not first fill it seems to me - all 9 years old I'm toldThe 2020 Loch Gorm was more interesting from the complexity, perhaps due to the mix of some older matured spirit 11-13 years and got a fat 90 points from me.Not sure if the spirit is really suited to all sherry as the bourbon casks work so well.Therefore this one only gets 88 points from a Kilchoman fanboy. Would still recommend a buy for around 75 EUR in Germany."
5345,Kilchoman Loch Gorm  2021 Edition,"Quite unusual to find a struck match in a Kilchoman. But since it remains subtle, it does not represent a flaw and only provides an exciting factor. A nice whisky.The sherry barrels get going right away, providing fermented grapes, blackberries and leather on the nose. And there actually seems to be a small note of a torn match working its way forward. To use the bad word: sulfur. Mild smoke, smoked ham, pepper, paprika spice.Dry start, makes a mature impression from the start (since I had the young Kilchoman Loch Gruinart in the glass shortly before, this is very noticeable). Blackberries, blueberries, grapes, dark chocolate, freshly roasted coffee beans. The peat smoke does not float above everything, but firmly adheres to the aromas. The match from the nose cannot be made out on the tongue.Medium long, slightly dry, increasingly spicy. Berry sweetness, moldy wood, leather."

It makes for a slow but even maturation, leading to a balanced whisky. It's powerful enough, but greatly soft and ""sweet"".Distinct smokiness, not really in your face. It's rather toffee-ish and nutty, on Christmas Pudding. Still some citrus (orange zest), still some barley and soft spice.Rather sweet, almost raisin-like, but with good punch. Christmas cake is dominant, the smoke is there but very gently. Further, mixed nuts, date, toffee, a bit of citric acidity and warming cinnamon.Rich, moderately sweet and warming on spice and nuts.

Accordingly, the whiskys are now more mature and older. Loch Gorm is the Sherry Edition, here from the Oloroso Butt. The 2019 edition contains whiskys from 2006-2009 and 2011. And of course it is heavily peated. The natural color clearly shows the sherry influence and is copper-colored. www.glen-efze.deThe sherry is present in the nosing and combines well with the strong, maritime Islay smoke. Behind the smoke are the ripe fruits, peach and apricot, but above all smoke. The smoke has mainly ashy aromas and a nice, warm note of wood.Kilchoman is a beautiful Islay whisky. At Loch Gorm, the beautiful, red-fruity aromas come together with the sherry. The whisky has now matured well and has sweetness, depth and fruit compote with smoking wood. The smoke is not only ashy, it also has more musty aromas in the maritime world. The sherry makes the whisky warm and deep, but it is also dry and aromatic.Even with 46% vol. the whisky is strong and round. The smoke is clear and stays in the mouth. The finish is dry with aromatic wood and clear smoke. A great whisky from the Isle of Islay, which has now established itself as an independent brand and can now offer well-matured whiskys with a usable age. Loch Gorm is a really good Kilchoman with sherry maturation."
5361,Kilchoman Loch Gorm  2019 Edition,"Pour is clear, golden amber. Scent is peat, strong and intense, yet refined. Taste is full, peat, booze, works quite well ! elegant, dry, intense, mild nuttyness. Full finish. meaty. Peat is blended in very nicely, Oloroso is expressed trough a certain dryness and a whiff of nuttyness by it's oxidative character. Appreciate it a lot more than the same bottle 1 year earlier, I must be opening up to peat, as I really, passionately hate it's usage in beer-aged-on-peated-whisky-barrel.

5362,Kilchoman Loch Gorm  2019 Edition,"The Loch Gorm 2019 is not stingy with its smoky character side. You get decent tobacco products. Very nice part. I really like the smoke and sherry combo. A malt for not every day and not every occasion. A little ""smoke"" bold, which is particularly strong in terms of taste.Light amber shimmers in the glass. Loch Gorm immediately begins with a very powerful smoke attack. Charcoal fire with smoked aromas and grilled food pickled in BBQ sauce. You immediately feel as if you are having an outdoor barbecue. In the smoke, however, sweet notes can also be clearly smelled, which form a nice transition to the dark berry fruit components in the smell. Over time, the smoke changes, becomes more spicy, herbs and juniper leaves have been thrown into the fire. The fruits change from berries more towards dried figs, dates and plums. With a few drops of water it becomes sweeter and even something like a soft vanilla comes out. However, the smoke remains dominant.Immediately a voluminous start with heavy smoke in the luggage. Despite the only 46% alcohol content, the little smoking dwarf gives a lot of gas in the mouth. A lot of ashy smoke right at the beginning with a lot of herbal influence in the taste. Slightly astringent. The sweetie says hello briefly after starting and then disappears again to make way for the kitchen herbs, such as oregano and marjoram. In addition, a nice light ginger seasoning. The fruit from the nose is discreetly in the background.The ashes from the campfire can be enjoyed for a long time, together with the herbs that still give off their aromas in the outgoing fire. Lies nice and warm in the throat. At the end, a tart tobacco note with the combination of dark, dried berries crystallizes out."

Nougat chocolate, caramel candy, soft fudge.Soft and smooth start, directly dosed sherry sweetness with raisins, dried figs, ripe grapes. On the tongue with clear smoke, still holding back more than dashing forward. Chocolate notes and cocoa powder accept the fruit notes well and are closely related.

Fine sandalwood, red currant, some cinnamon, mace, raisins, vanilla, caramelized peanuts. The aromas are very balanced and harmonious and prepare the palate great for the first sip. Great job. Nothing stings, nothing pinches. Just round, juicy and inviting.On the palate, initially oily sweetness, then the smoky taste sets in very clearly. The maritime note only develops again in the finish, while oily sherry, dark fruits, raisins, vanilla, prunes, sandalwood, cardamom and honey burn off the fireworks on the palate.Long finish, with smoky sweetness and sparkling mint on the palate.

The real problem here is that the sherry tastes 'fake' - like sherry seasoning - slightly tart, bringing a weird acrid floral note. A real shame. Interesting but not the lovely character of previous. A let down. 3.2/77"

5400,Kilchoman Sanaig,"A balanced combination of peat and sherry, with none of them overwhelming. It displays some sweet red fruits notes with a warm, salty smokiness.

I hate to rate this below 85 but it's really not more than easy very easy sipping fun stuff where the fun factor should be higher... maybe having a bad day will see in few weeks."
5409,Kilchoman Sanaig,"My very first Kilchoman. The smell is that of tobacco smoke at its best. Like as an ex-smoker, so very sometimes I suddenly smelled a wapper from a cigarette (Gauloise is famous / infamous) and can smell not horrible but just as deeply, full of homesickness and desire, longing back for the rare spicy comfort that cigarettes so very sometimes bring . Addictions bring out the lyrical poet in people, you can see that again here. Vincent had his Absinthe, Paul & John had LSD, I had la dame Gauloise. On the palate, the smoke is mild, juicy (juicy smoke? Omvlee, are you okay?) And constructive - it supports and enhances the mild cherry, wood and (far away ...) vanilla notes. Softly sweet, complete, casual and without harsh notes, this whisky is complete but has no outliers, which makes it a bit anonymous. The sherry is not very present, and that was the reason why I bought it. The finish is warm, peppery, drying in the mouth, with woody notes and ash. Conclusion: good stuff. Promises more (sherry) than it delivers. Not much depth - NAS, low price, let's go. Pull up a cigarette after 13 years of abstinence. And thanks. I still have the rest of the bottle."
5410,Kilchoman Sanaig,"Not as sherried as the dark colour suggests. Found the flavours to just be too discordant with this bottle. The peat and sherry don’t really sing well together. There is a bit of Kilchoman distillate pushing through here which is nice. But it’s overwhelmed by burnt sherry elements that doesn’t add sweetness to the development. Not a bad dram, but won’t be a repeat buy for me. I’m more curious to find some more naked, exbourbon Kilchoman in the future."
5411,Kilchoman Sanaig,Good PLV. Also a solid Peat + Oloroso drop due to the typical Kilchoman light grass aroma - but not much more.

Vanilla, ripe and dried fruits: dark and red cherries, plums, milk chocolate Then spices comes in: cinnamon, pepper, dry oak.Medium long, peaty and smoky, but it remains sweet and a bit spicy."
5415,Kilchoman Sanaig,"In 2017 I’ve visited this idillic distillery on the far west of Islay. It caught me since that day but somehow every time I wanted to buy a few bottles and/or samples I ended up buying different stuff. But...Finally...this week I pulled the trigger and bought 14 samples and 1 bottle of Kilchoman. Time for an in depth liquid tour of what this distillery can produce! This is the 5thTypical Kilchoman nose instantly. Lovely sherry flavors combined with some sweet bourbon-like flavors. I get unripe strawberry, cherry and bramble combined with a thick layer of vanilla. Also quite some younger barley notes like sugar and grains.Full of flavor with quite some dry oak flavors. Quite some vanilla, cinnamon and orangepeel. It appears to be rather youthful in this part. It behaves quite restless. Upon arrival some specific flavors are to be detected but soon it feels rather neutral, sharp and peppery.In the medium length finish it recovers a bit. Again I get these typical tobacco- and leather-like flavors. It leafs the mouth tingling again. Something I often experience with Kilchoman. Water makes this one less youthful but also rather flat. Although it is tasteful, this would not be my first choice when buying a Kilchoman. I think it’s a little too restless for that."

Nice contrast between sweetness and slightly sour and bitter notes.Especially in this segment, the seasoning is probably not for everyone, I like it."
5428,Knockando 1994  Master Reserve,"Here I have to be grateful for the sample from André as an encore. I don't have to stay long either, because it is one of the whiskys that hardly deserves its age. Especially in the transition to the finish, a complete deregistration of the sensory impressions from 21 years of maturation. The fact is: the nose saves the 84 points.If you know the whisky, this nose is not that bad compared to your own performance. The interplay between sherry vanilla plus light citrus-like fruitiness from the bourbon world and the announcement of wood in wood with predominantly wood, or something like that :-) With the nose deep in the barrel.It runs in sweetly and the texture is creamy and full at the beginning, but after a few moments in the mouth it becomes harsh and spicy with these registered wood notes from the nose. Already at the transition it becomes bitter and carpentry heavy. Too many wood chips are lying around. A touch of sherry tries to save the day. But the balance between 21 years of maturation is different. Sorry, I would almost like to speak of missing notes at this point. Management neglected homework.It stays for a relatively long time but only due to the bitterness and the dehydration and if it weren't for the dusty wood and the misty vanilla, you wouldn't believe that this is a 21 malt. A blind tasting would get out of hand here. What he can show in this case is a recognition value. Positive or negative is a matter of taste. My conclusion: Life is too short ....."
5429,Knockando 1994  Master Reserve,"Class!At first the wood, the oak, dominates. He is old enough. The fruit is fruity with very slight vanilla.In the taste rather spicy. A load of juniper, beetroot, very light sherry, creamy.The empty glass smells of oak and vanilla - just as I like it."
5430,Knockando 1994  Master Reserve,"In contrast to the quite edgy wooden board from 1990, which I recently tasted, the 94 is now again a really tasty number with the age of corresponding intensity, for 65 € ""very drinkable"".relatively dry, sawdust, old dust, some acidity, white wine, there is something else fruity, could be a berry note, fresh raspberry or red currant, and a hint of dark chocolate, almost no sweetnessfirst fruity, orange marmalade, or better orange gummy, a little honey, then a lot of drinking cocoa with some pepperlong, warm, pepper, cocoa, a little camillan"
5431,Knockando 1994  Master Reserve,"Nose: fruity juicy oranges, fresh grapefruit, lime, fresh fruity tartness, hardly any sweetness in the nose, oak notes in the background well perceptible, but never dominiant, slightly dusty like sawdust from rotten wood  Taste: Wood, in contrast to the nose a lot of oak and almost no fruit, slightly bitter, tart, slightly dry, but then comes on a light sweetness and light chocolate / coffee notes, but which are mostly overshadowed by tart wood, such a slightly biting stringy woody wort lies above everything. Also about the sherry fruits, which I can find only with the second sip. A mixture of oranges and occasionally a hint of red berries. The finish is quite long for 43% and becomes extremely dry and sawdust aromatic.  Conclusion: The 1994 18-year-old Knockando tastes better. This one has a really nice nose, but in the mouth it's too harsh, woody just for my taste not in balance or too long in the barrel. Drinkable yes - but at the price I get better like Aberlour 18 or Cardhu 18"
5432,Knockando 1994  Master Reserve,"He has a rather unusual nose with an interplay of pleasant tannins and decent fruitiness, the former predominating. On the palate the aroma profile in the nose corresponds well and acceptable strength. You can enjoy it well, provided that the somewhat superficial tannins don't bother you.Strong caramel at the beginning, nut cake, honey and vanilla. Later overripe apples, a sweet Red Bull gummy fruit note. Then coffee beans.soft on the palate, nutty, with light fruits and honey.

Clean with a medium persistence."
5435,Knockando 1994  Master Reserve,"Aroma: sweet honey, milk caramel, coffee with milk, dark raisins, prunes, black currant wiped with sugar, second wave - old lacquered furniture, dusty books, minerals (stone crumb), after some time fresh sliced ginger appears, blooming lilac . The fragrance is constantly revealed and begins to play with new colors, good!  Taste: sweet ginger, extra black chocolate, black coffee with sugar, dark raisins, brown demerara sugar.  Finish: medium length, chocolate and coffee gradually leaving sweetness in bitterness, compote of dried fruits, prunes, spices.  Rating: 86  Bottom line: the aroma is closed, time-consuming, but gradually introduces something new and develops - I really liked it; after that you expect something similar from taste and finish, but alas, everything is pretty simple and monotonous here, but of course the balance is at a height - the coffee and chocolate theme is traced from aroma to finish."

5438,Lagavulin 08-year-old,"I’ve always found the the 8 year to be a lighter, more accessible version of the 12 year old cask strength annual release. However, it is still a very punchy dram. The peat attack is razor sharp, crystalline - don’t expect any funkiness or barnyard notes. Really oily and acidic. A surprisingly long finish for something bottled at 48%. Not really all that complex, but a good way of getting a sense of a clear cut Lagavulin without spending a ridiculous amount on the 12yo."
5439,Lagavulin 08-year-old,"https://www.whiskynotes.be/2018/lagavulin/lagavulin-8-years-2017/Nose: there’s a bit more youth in this version. Whereas the bicentenary version is fairly balanced, this one is slightly rougher, with more hints of peanut butter, popcorn and the scented (new-makeish) notes of candyfloss. Slightly more alcoholic punch as well. Smoked meat. Lemon and pickle brine. Tarry ropes, but less earthy and less balanced than it predecessor. Mouth: more of a young, mezcal-y character again, it seems its profile has shifted a little towards the 12. White pepper, big peat – and quite some heat. Sweet vanilla toffee and smoky oak in a second wave.  Even more distillate-driven? Sooty, ashy, coastal. Smoked kippers. Still a bit of this nutty side. Finish: long, warmer now, on roasted nuts, hints of chocolate, warm ashes and black pepper.Although the ABV is identical, this one seems more in-your-face than the limited edition, as well as coming across younger. There’s a small chance that it comes down to bottle airing (the limited edition has been open since 2016) but in any case the limited edition was clearly the better one for me. "

This combined with the 'fat' earthy peat makes for an explosion of taste in your mouth. Later sips add vanilla, light fruitiness and (smoked) oak.Finish: Medium long with a warm feeling. Hints of chocolate.Overall Rating: 83Final thoughts: As this was my first sip of Lagavulin in a long time, I was quite happy with the outcome.

On the way back from my ski holiday in Austria, I discovered this young Lagavulin at the airport for a very fair price. So I gave it a new home.Smoke, tar, ashes, kelp, smouldering wood and finger paint, upholstered with honey, almonds, apricots, lemon and pencil lead… textbook Lagavulin indeed. But rather docile if you don’t mind me saying. There is nothing wrong with that anyway.On the palate, the sweetness comes first and next to the citrus I also get some orchard fruit. Suddenly the smoke becomes quite big followed by the typical ashes. Walnuts. Sea salt. Camphor. Nice spiciness too. That’s more like it.The finish is pretty long, peppery with a hint of candied orange peel. Quite intense.I rate this slightly above the 8 years old that was bottled for the 200th anniversary. It’s also more enjoyable (to me) than the 9 years old in the Game of Thrones series. But it still is not classic 16 years old. Nevertheless a lovely Lagavulin at a good strength."

That's why I don't want to give it any points, because it is definitely worth every penny for lovers.Damp peat in the warehouse and a smoldering campfire.

5463,Lagavulin 16-year-old  Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"I personally think it is the most fascinating single malt whisky in Islay Island. In the past, these 16yo malts only sold around NTD1300, which can be said to be super crazy. In previous publicity, it was said that 16 yo can best express the taste that the distillery wants to express, so the basic model is as high as 16 years old. However, in recent years, the young 8-year-old wine has been launched as the core range, which is still very important in business. In addition, the price has risen so much this year, returning to the 16-year-old price point. I regret not buying more before... The total taste is 88 points, and the price does not affect the score.Smoked bacon, orange, floral fragranceSegmented impact, the first wave is the soft taste of floral fragrance and orange juice, Immediately, the peat of smoked bacon, black pepper and dark chocolate hits it, which is very comfortable.The floral and smoky fragrance lasts for a long time."
5464,Lagavulin 16-year-old  Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"There's been an opinion this 16yo flagship whisky has declined in character over the years. I also think this is the case. I'm guessing there's less older stock in the blend and the rare old sherry barrels are probably being replaced with younger ones and maybe sherry seasoned casks. That said, it's still a great scotch and one of my favorites. I feel incomplete if it's not on my shelf.Nose: Lapsang souchong tea, charred meat, mud, swamp grass. Faintly fruity. Roasted peanuts. Smells a bit medicinal - betadine. Palate: Sweet. The peat takes on a mossy funkiness here. Finish: Strongly phenolic. Late seaweed."
5465,Lagavulin 16-year-old  Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"An indispensable and outstanding standard whisky in perfect drinking strength. Of course you could say it's a little thin, but I don't need every whisky in CS. Pleasant, honest, nice age and well priced, what more could you want?Sweet and wonderfully smoky. Campfire, ashtray, iodine, seaweed, sea breeze, tobacco, oranges, liquorice. There is a lot to discover here, great!Pleasantly dry. Sweetish smoke, with a lot of salt and a bit of bitterness. The alcohol is well integrated and strong enough.Long! Nice and warm, with some fruit and vanilla."
5466,Lagavulin 16-year-old  Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Not an overly complex single malt, but an extremely drinkable one that is easy to enjoy. Value (£49) : 7/10Sweet butterscotch and salted caramel note up front. An earthy peat with slightly iodine and maritime-like notes of seaweed. Dried dates and plums. Some apples and pears with some milk chocolate. Savoury smoked meats and old leather. Cinnamon, nutmeg and more oak spices.Rather oily and creamy mouthfeel. Raisins, pears and butterscotch.

5468,Laphroaig 10-year-old,"A revelation to some but simply disgusting to others, Laphroaig 10 is arguably the most intense of all Single Malts. Your taste buds are shocked by the unfamiliar, dominated by dry peatiness. The nose reminds of an old steam engine, road tar and burned rubber. Rotting seaweed, iodine and mineral notes combine with chimney smoke, TCP and a cold ashtray. Flavorwise, an overwhelming phenolic blast subdues the underlying sweetness. Crisp oak and salty dryness characterize the peaty finish. Whether you love it or hate it, you will never forget it!RATING: 3.4/5.0 stars ≙ 82 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE [-]"
5469,Laphroaig 10-year-old,"Matured in 1-st fill ex-bourbon casks. Thick, slowly forming, long legs. Chill-filtered and coloured. Water enhances sweetness on the account of smokiness.

5472,Laphroaig 10-year-old,It's a good easy drinking Islay malt. Maybe the best if you want to get in touch with peated whisky for good money... also good for smoked cocktails. To me as I love the Laphroaig distillery ( the old 18 and the 10CS some of the greatest malts released in a core range) it just lacks too much everywhere very watery...with 48% this would be easily within the AB10 /Laga 8 range - smoke needs fire in this expression the water killed the fire. I like the QC at 48% much more even as a NAS.
5473,Laphroaig 10-year-old,"One of the very best smokey and peaty whiskies in the world. Macho, not penetrating into the nose, but all-round very drinkable despite the intensity. Never gets boring.Smoke, sea, medicinal.Smoke, peat, butter, alcohol. A pure and strong taste, very recognizable.Long aftertaste. Smoke and peat."
5474,Laphroaig 10-year-old,"Value (£28) : 8/10Medicinal peat upfront, but not as intense as I had expected. Some light vanilla notes and caramels as well.More peat here, but again not as much as I would have expected. slight Honey sweetness with bitter notes of coffee.The peat is most evident here on the finish"
5475,Laphroaig 10-year-old,"The regular 10 year old didn't cross my path for at least 5 years now. It's still ok, with the typical medicinal and coastal profile, but also a lot more woody and dusty than I remember."
5476,Laphroaig 10-year-old,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. I think, with the exception of the Balvenie DoubleWood (which is a personal favourite at this level), it's probably the best thing on a supermarket shelf.It's not overly complex, but the flavours it does have are strong. I've read a few comments on here regarding the ABV not being strong enough; I actually disagree, I think the 40% works really well with this.The nose is powerful with lots of smoke and medicinal notes. I also picked up on lots of citrus, and after 15 minutes in the glass I also got some vanilla.BANG. This is only 40%?! It's very much a continuation of the nose; there really isn't any fruit, just lots of smoke, leather, medicinal notes and a slight cream after a few mouthfuls.I found the finish to be short and very smooth, understandable without much burn at this abv."
5477,Laphroaig 10-year-old,"Comparison Laphroaig 10, 40% AbV, WID 42885 - stale vs. fresh  2cl 1 year in the bottle vs. 2cl from the fresh opened bottle  https://www.whiskybase.com/.../wh.../42885/laphroaig-10-year-old  #WagnerAlexTastingNotes  One year ago I put 2cl Laphi 10 in an empty bottle and since then the flat has been shaken and opened regularly (at least once a week). Today, the single malt was compared to a ""fresh"" Laphi 10.  In the following, I will only discuss the main differences.  Aroma:  old: quieter, sweeter, more vanilla, earthier  new: edgier, younger, more ashen smoke, floral  Taste:  old: bitter, mineral, not really tasty (nicely expressed)  new: much rounder and more balanced  Finish / aftertaste:  new: a touch stronger  Comment:  An interesting experiment with finally clear winner. In the aroma, I found the old Laphi much more lovely and ""salivating,"" but the taste of the old, stale Laphroaig 10 was not for me. I also could not finish the dram and he walked into the casting. Thus...  Points:  new: 90/100 (yes, for me still one of the best standards, even though he only has 40% ABV)  alt: 75/100 (the aroma saves him from total crash)"
5478,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"A very mild whisky that looks very light. He is quite complex, for me, however, lacks the emphasis that a Laphroaig should actually have. I have to correct myself, the emphasis comes from the second sip too, yet it seems filigree. Is a very successful whisky that is able / was to tap new shoppers, which was certainly its purpose in travel value. Personally, he is a bit too smooth.First, ripe peaches and seaweed, only after a few moments does phenolic smoke with mineral notes, iodine and carbite, a touch of disinfectant. The nose looks very delicate, the smoke is also rather restrained. This does not change with durability, but this brings out more caramel and a slightly artificial candy note, overall it looks a bit darker now. A dark malt-disinfectant combination establishes itself as the main note. Again and again boiled peaches flash up. Warms dominated by a peaty dark toffee note, the acidic disinfectant becomes a marginal phenomenon. The nose is now expected to be much richer.In the mouth, it is similarly restrained and soft, but actually everything from the nose can be found here. The mouthfeel is slightly oily and the alcohol is well integrated. Significant acidity runs from the bottom up through the mouth while on the tongue cooked peaches with blockade sauce dance. Slowly, a pinch of pepper comes on. Even when leaving, there is only an idea of ​​bitterness. The second sip of the oak becomes clearer, but remains altogether discreet.The finish itself is naturally long, and also noticeably warms as the sweetness goes down and ashes remain on the tongue. The oak does not matter anymore. In the end slightly sugary, like starch."
5479,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"A great Laphroaig which is characterized by a greasy smoked meat note. I like it very much!A typical Laphroaignase pours out of the glass. The nose begins its work in a greasy and peaty way, the smoked meat becomes more intense and mineral peat becomes slightly smoky. Sweet vanilla and malted barley exude a wonderful Islay aroma.Dirty and stinging peat dominates the first impression. Again this greasy smoke and mineral notes. Now wood flavors are noticeable which easily gain in sharpness. Sweetness and a touch of fruit emerge behind the intense peat note, subtle smoke completes a great taste experience.The finish begins with a harsh, yet sweet peat note. Discreetly sharp wood aromas rise from the peat, mineral and floral notes show up. For a long time, the finish exudes a chubby warm mouthfeel."
5480,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"Arguably the best NAS Laphroaig in the current OB range. Beats the Lore, Brodir, 1815 and Triple Wood.A salty smoke, medicinal, farmy notes, hay, Dijon mustard, pu-erh tea, vanilla, lavender, some citrus fruits, salted caramel, walnuts and a touch of mint.A greasy smokiness, medicinal, black pepper, sandal wood, piccalilly, liquorice, some citrus fruits and vanilla.Very long: campfire like wood smoke, herbal (tarragon), seaweed, salted black liquorice."
5481,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"A nice smoky note mixes with the sweetness of vanilla. Roasted aromas are also noticeable, such as caramel and chocolate. On the very edge there is also a flowery note to it seems to be quite lavender even though quite and really.First, the delicately sweet smoke dominates. Then add vanilla and malt notes.Also in the finish dominates first the tender sweetness of smoke before he is caught up by the alcoholic strength. If the alcohol gives off a nice campfire remains where you sit still long."
5482,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,Blindverkostung.Very strong. Smoke gets straight in your nose. He does not dominate but is well integrated. Behind it maritime notes. Citrus fruits. Peppermint. Vanilla. Caramel. Walnuts. Wet wood. Coffee beans.Spicy start. A lot of pepper. Bitter oranges. Dark chocolate. Coffee beans. Salt. Wet wood.Long. Peat smoke. Drying. Cocoa.
5483,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"Nice dirty Laphroaig ;-) I like the intense oak character in the end.Salt, floral notes, massive peat smoke but it fades a little bit as soon as it is in the glass a little longer. Something leathery, ""farm flavors"", slightly dried hay and citrus flavorsPeat, citrus fruits, a lot of oak, salt, a little honey, malt, liquoriceLong lasting and a bit bitter. Some oak in the end."
5484,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"Too bad he does not wear age. The distinct oak taste in the finish but suggests that some older barrels have found their way into this bottling. A very nice malt!Rich, thick and full nose. Sweet Roses and peat, wonderfully coordinated. As soon as the nose gets used to the peat, the scent of a wildflower meadow comes to the fore.Very creamy mouthfeel. Slightly medically, but tipping directly into sweetness. Salty sea breeze. Salmiak and tar, as well as the sweetness of wildflower honey.Long and creamy. Oak shapes the finish."
5485,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"A decent NAS Laphroaig, fine but passionless. A recommendation especially if you're into the more austere and oaky side of Laphroaig.One dram note.The first sniff offers old acquaintances, hemp rope, tar, some iodine, roasted beef steak, diesel exhaust fumes, some sea spray, a little clam shells, some rust, moments later a berry cotton candy note evolves and is alongside a tarry hemp rope note the most prominent one.A little boisterous on the arrival, austere and sweet at the same time, some iodine, tar, hemp rope, candy corn, some oak sap, dry, a little unbalanced, even harsh at the first sip, but evolves nicely, big body as usual with NCF Laphroaigs.a little blunt and austere woodiness (european oak), tarry hemp rope, some cotton candy, a hint of iodine, dry, medium to long."
5486,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"An extremely spicy representative of its kind, literally peppery, with a lot of sparkling / fresh oak - a little like a wine barrel maturation without wine.  Still very tasty, but I would always prefer the Lore (for the same price) or the Quarter Cask (for the half price)."
5487,Laphroaig An Cuan Mòr,"Nice whisky despite the fact that it’s NAS. Very “Laphroaigy” expression with proper strengths and medicinal nature, however, it’s quite rounded. Very good balance and overall drinkability. Quite expensive as for NAS but worth the price on my opinion.Smoky, slightly medicinal, maritime (seaweed, oysters), wood ashes, damp earth, dried fruits (apricots and raisins), honey and caramel notes, marmalade, some lemon. Water opens up farmy notes and fruit acid dropsSlightly sweet and salty, smoky and ashy, phenolic, iodine, brine, lemon peel, some green apple notesRather long, slowly getting dry, a bit oaky, salty, nutty"
5488,Laphroaig Four Oak,"With that, Laphroaig has really done no favor. He is not under any cannon, but Laphroaig may expect much more. The nose is still quite interesting, but even on the tongue you can tell him an immature youth, which also shows in the very short and actually only smoky finish. Where now exactly the influence of the four different barrels shows - no idea. Too bad that something like that gets cut out.Phenolic smoke with lemon flavor. Some stuffy wood in the background. Seaweed. Light and airy for a Laphroaig, but not thin.Lemon smoke again, but in a more dilute form than in the nose. Slightly metallic, with the taste of pebbles. A little salt, a little licorice, a bit of honey. But much more will not come then.Short. Too short. He leaves after a short time only cold smoke and a metallic aftertaste."
5489,Laphroaig Four Oak,"Boh, but Laphroaig has really embarrassed! The nose is not 100% my thing, but overall very complex, quite interesting and in my opinion not behave at all, but rather equipped with a certain plumpness. What happens in the mouth, however, is shameful. Admittedly, no metallic approaches, not in the slightest, but still that is an absolute pharynx cleaner. Since I have Laphis with over 60% on the shelf, which have much less sharpness. The departure then makes sure that you do not keep it in bad memory, if you remember it at all, because there is no reason for it. Pity!Boom, first a neat turn phenolic smoke with kernel soap underlaid. Luckily, after a few seconds, the curd soap is much less intense, with caramel and a few mineral notes. After a while, add smoked meat and some disinfectants to the bouquet. Overall, the whole thing looks pretty musty. Unfortunately, after a short period of smoky meat, garlic, peaty caramel and granite dust merging into a beguiling mix, it is increasingly flattening and the soap is back. Disinfectant and stone dust are heated quite intensively, some citrus scares now also from behind in the nose. Overall, now clearly too angry.If the nose was at least quite interesting, then there's an alcohol club in the mouth. Really? Only 40% ?? Man, must he be young! Interestingly, but no sheet metal. In order to be able to define anything more sweet and smoky, the mouth first has to get used to the alcohol, in other words become numb. Boy, the third swallow is actually too spritig and sharp. Nothing against strong alcohol, but he should somehow be involved. A slight alcohol note can now also make out. Otherwise, unfortunately, there really is not much, a little dark caramel, slightly sugary, strong acidity from behind and a slightly superficial bitterness, which is increasingly established as the main note. He is unfortunately of a rather watery consistency.The finish is expected to be relatively long, with dark, caramel sweetness and behind the palate adhering, slightly chemical acid slowly fade away, to completely leave the palate a somewhat soapy (but interestingly not unpleasant) ashiness."
5490,Laphroaig Four Oak,"Four Oak probably does not mean ""4 great, selected Fassreifungen"" but ""everything on young xth-fill barrels zusammengekippt, what we could not otherwise use"". For phenol and oil flap fans it might be something if it were not so thin, but for 55 € / liter is not enough.little sweetness (caramel), a lot of phenol, disinfectant, formaldehyde, used dilution, oily workshop cloths, at first a bit pungent (but this is limited), maybe a splash of lemon, a bit grassy, ​​looks rather chemical than ""natural""again almost no sweetness except a little caramel, mouthfeel creamy with pepper, less phenolic / disinfectant, more ashen, bitter, it stays longer in the mouth -> more pepper, more bitter, again the oily swabmedium long, pepper, ashes, bitter"
5491,Laphroaig Four Oak,"Hmmm, this is rather dissapointing. It is far from special. The nose is ok, but the taste isn’t good, actually there is not much taste. This is definitely not the best Laphroaig out there.There is some peat here, and it’s briny too. A little bit of seaweed. Also some soft vanilla aromas. A hint of lemon sourness, followed by ash. It’s a little lighter than what I’m used to from Laphroaig.It’s starts rather smoky. A thin mouthfeel, but this gets a little bit better later on. A bit peppery. Some vanilla on the background, and a pinch of liquorice. But that was about it. It’s flat and a bit out of balance.The finish is quite short, and a bit spicy. This is followed by some metallic notes."
5492,Laphroaig Four Oak,"Nose: again a new NAS of Laphi - look - ah smokier than the Select, slightly medical and salty smoke, sour lemon, pleasantly sweet and slightly grassy, ​​the nose is simple and pleasing, which does not have to be bad.  Taste: uih is thin, very smoky and peppery with a fresh and sour lemon note and nothing else. This sour note is even stronger in the finish, the smoke is milder and it adds a subtle oak bitterness.  If the nose was still good in its simplicity, it completely falls apart in the mouth. The is now not a complete failure - he has no big Fehlnoten (if one of sour drops is ^ ^) and is very tasty but there is somehow missing in every nook and cranny. It's a pity what happened to Laphi. Apart from the 10cc CS, none of the bottles in the affordable segment are more convincing - let alone the whole NAS."
5493,Laphroaig Four Oak,
5494,Laphroaig Four Oak,"Four Oak? Can anyone tell me what the point of it is? This does not look good on their CV. I was given this as a gift so can't complain too much. Would I spend my hard earned on it? Like shite I would.Actually the nose isn't bad at all, quite mellow, gentle and dare I say soft. Slightly soiled straw bedding, light fruit notes and watered down disinfectant. Not a complex nose, in fact it is better off where it is and and how it stands, no better and no worse.The first thing that hits home is how watery it tastes. If it never said 40% on the label I would have said it was less than that. This just knocks it all to hell and gives it a metallic taste. Coming in a poor second are the light fruit flavours with a pinch and I mean a pinch of white pepper. I mean this isn't unpleasant but for a Laphroaig you expect something more substantial and meaty.The finish is short to medium and again there is that watery metallic taste. In fact it tastes like I'm sucking on an old brillo pad."
5495,Laphroaig Four Oak,"This whisky is not like classic 10 years old or even Octave cask. The drink is very pleasant and smooth, tasty and balanced. Great skill of master of distillery to mix four casks!If Your expectation is strong peat character it is not the one. It might be great for introduction with Laphroaig but overpriced in this case.P.S. Empty dram keeps pleasant and strong wood notes.Iodine and salty with notes of prunes, dried fruits and light sherry and peated smoke with malt at the end. Needs some time to be opened. Flavor is delicate but not so strong and complex as it could be.Pleasant peat. Strong notes of oak, sandalwood and fruit tree wood, vanilla, cooked and dried apples, apricots, pears. Little bit spicy.IMHO taste is the best part of the drink.Warming, stable but short. Sweet, vanilla, a loot of wood elements and very pleasant peat. Also returns notes of sherry. In a several minutes brings notes of cheese."
5496,Laphroaig Four Oak,"young, thin, one-dimensional - disappointingFermented grass, sillage, phenolic smoke, soapsuds, green rhubarb - thinIodine and smoke, brackish water - very watery, almost a whisky spritzermedically, but short"
5497,Laphroaig Four Oak,
5498,Laphroaig Lore,"Bought this as a holiday dram.While Laphroaig's statement claiming this to be the ""richest of all single malt scotch whiskies"" might be an exaggeration, this is definitely a deliciously complex dram. It reminds me most of the Ardbeg Uigeadail and that is a very good thing in my opinion.It's a spicy chilli bomb, with that typical smoke, idione and ash profile inherent to Laphroaig. Although it's a NAS bottling, the leathery, tobacco qualities give away the fact that there are definitely some older components in this mix (rumor has it there is whisky as old as 21 years mixed in the equation that makes up the Lore). The most impressive feat the Lore displays in my opinion is that fact that the oloroso casks stand out by not being too apparent or obvious. The sherry influence is meticulously balanced so that it gives off its sweetness without ever taking the upper hand. It's always there, but in the background, so that the typical Laphroaig taste with the added oakiness and tobacco, along with some tasty nuttiness and vanilla and the very apparent spicy chilli bite, really get to shine.Concludingly; in terms of Laphroaig's current range (at least up until the 18 y/o), this is definitely the most richly flavored Laphroaig available right now. To me, this might even top the Ardbeg Uigeadail, and that says A LOT! A definite must-buy for fans of Islay whiskies."
5499,Laphroaig Lore,"You still can adumbrate the distillery character in the initial nose. The taste is round and soothing, the finish long and mellow. All in all not a bad dram, but neither an excellent one. Appeasement to the masses, to reach a broader audience. Not for a Laphroaig lover, but a novice. The presentation is simple and stylish, while the price for a NAS is just ridiculous."
5500,Laphroaig Lore,"Really wonderful Laphroaig, complex and tasty.Review: https://youtu.be/EVVj5QKsoYATypical Laphroaig nose, lots of medicinal notes and peat smoke, brine, lemon oil, then hay, little bit of tar, tobacco, and the lightest raisin and prune notes. Honey and smoked vanilla. Nice.Yum. Perfect alcohol level, warm and a light bite, very full with good sweetness, apple juice, good dose of peat smoke and medicinal notes, some toffee, lots of barley, then some oak. The second chew is even richer and more complex with some peppermint, smoke still building up, light ginger joins in. If this was affordable today it would be among my ""always open"" bottles for sure. Third chew also brings waffles, crème chantilly, a bit of custard, toasted barley. Complex and yet so balanced, and first of all very tasty, and a huge dram to boot.Peppermint, band-aids, peat smoke, custard, barley, and smoked vanilla. Marvellous, but a bit short."
5501,Laphroaig Lore,"[Tasted blind]N: I’m guessing Laphroaig straight off the bat with a profile that speaks of sweet sawdusty vegetal peat,… and very buttery/olive oily, onion yoghurt,.. Perky and chatty overall.T: Decent enough weighty arrival, but anything would be after an Auchentoshan at 40% abv. A vegetal-sweet smoky, mechanics-oily dram with an Indian yoghurty dip,… Builds in intensity, so perhaps this one is around 46%[+] abv? I’ve no doubt this is Laphroaig.F: Barley smoke,…well-charred wood, a nice green-ish barley oiliness, peat-fresh smoke stretches out,.. Vegetal-dry vanilla at the death.C: Very nice, not mind-blowing. Revealed: Lore, no way!! I’ll never forget [or forgive myself for] buying this as a dream dram at Whisky Lounge 2016. Very different from TWE Show."
5502,Laphroaig Lore,"A bit difficult to evaluate, this one. Good potential and solid abv. but there seem to be batch variations and no age does not help here. If on sale for 65 EUR probably a good buy in times where the 16 and previous 18 are long gone or more expensive. But no buy for 90 EUR for sure. Could be more expressive with a longer finish, better casks uses. Pleasant but a bit too tame imho."
5503,Laphroaig Lore,"Typical Laphroaig, but also a clear sherry influence. Sweet, fruity, smoky, iodine.Very, very sweet on the tongue, then the hut burns down. Very mild and gentle at the front for 48%, then strongly spicy at the back.Starts drier, also flattens out quickly. The sweet peat smoke remains at moderate intensity for a while"
5504,Laphroaig Lore,"A bit of everything here. Peat carries a lot of different flavors that can be hard to pinpoint.

5508,Laphroaig PX Cask,I just tasted a recent 2017 bottling of this and I am fairly surprised that its still as good as I remember it to be. The px makes it easy to sip at 48%abv while still maintaining these lovely classic medicinal and leathery laphroaiggy notes. Not overtly complex but very enjoyable and definetly good value for money. 
5509,Laphroaig PX Cask,"Really interesting game between smoke, sherry and sweetness. He often changes his face. If you wait for the first sip, until it's only dry and then takes a new sip, the tart but is immediately gone and it starts again the game of sherry and sweet (in many others, it is just always tart when it once tart was).  I love it.Smoke; occurs very maritim (iodine). Then comes a sweet, fruity note (my salivation begins immediately); Sherry is building up; there are spices and malt; after the first sip the malt becomes clearer; Every now and then walnut nuts. Boa, he's really powerful for me.Smoke and sherry are immediately strongly represented. Then comes a powerful, slightly bitter oak. In addition, there is also a really sweet note. Maritime kelp touch is there and the smoke is changing. It gets a little drier in the mouth. Reminiscent of extinct campfire. He is also spicy (chili), first thought that it is the alcohol, but is a distinct spicy sharpness. After some time in the mouth, the malt comes out clearly. Still quite mild overall.Smoke and sherry; Mouth is dry, the oak shows again from her slightly bitter side. The note of sherry evaporates and it remains long harsh and dry smoke back."

5513,Laphroaig PX Cask,"Somewhat a sibling to the port cask travel retail version named Brodir. Just as solid at a good abv. And usually pretty affordable for a liter. Worth a buy, imho better than the Triple Wood which always had unusual sherry notes that seem a bit off to me. Recommended."
5514,Laphroaig PX Cask,"Nice Laphroaig with good value for money. More impressive, balanced and fruity than the Triple Wood, but significantly less fruity than the Brodir. In contrast to the quarter cask, you can leave the bottle half full for three or four years without hesitation. It does not deteriorate, it becomes even more vanilla.Quite subtle and fresh smoke for Laphroaig. In addition, a very light PX sweetness. Maritime smoke, like a campfire on the beach into which you throw a few old and damp planks of ships that have just been fished out of the water. In addition, vanilla, delicate oak spice, smoked fish, passion fruit and light, almost ripe cherries.Powerful start and also nice and oily. The alcohol is well integrated, as is usually the case with Laphroaig. Smoke, vanilla, honey, cherry ice cream, apricot.Medium-long finish. Light smoke, lots of vanilla, honey and some apricot."
5515,Laphroaig PX Cask,"The formula can be simple, yet exciting: just add some sherry sweetness to the earthy Laphroaig peat. The result isn't disappointing, but not convincing at all. Smoke and alcohol are quite overwhelming at first, while sherry notes aren't so remarkable and mostly bring a more rounded taste to this bold and young peated malt. Finish is shorter than expected and, again, only slightly influenced by the casks. A drop of water is helpful to open it up a bit, anyway it's surely enjoyable for any Laphroaig fan."

5519,Laphroaig Quarter Cask,"If the 10 is the pure expression of that salty, seaweed type of wet smoke, then this is a more complex and rich, dryer charcoal type of smoke that fills your entire mouth. Overall a superb effort from Laphroaig, considering the price."
5520,Laphroaig Quarter Cask,"If you're looking for a punch of peat at a very accessible price, this is the dram for you. Although a NAS, I'd pick this over the classic 10 any day.

5522,Laphroaig Quarter Cask,"The scent contains an old rotting bathhouse with hanging brooms, phenolic motifs and chemical smokiness. The taste is very oaky, with a lot of hot spices and phenols. The finish is tart, oaky, bitter with spices and phenols. It would be strange to expect from a small barrel that there will be no overburdening, otherwise the distillery is guessed without problems, a good release, even.

5523,Laphroaig Quarter Cask,"Quarter casks are a neat way to accelerate the aging process by increasing the wood influence in a given space of time (more surface area) whilst avoiding the often unenjoyable woodiness of virgin oak.

That being said, most other Islay distilleries offer more compelling options for only a little more money."

5539,Laphroaig Triple Wood,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deThe typical Laphroaig smoke is dominant with a medicinal-fresh undertone from the beginning. In the first few minutes after pouring the alcohol (48%) stings a little in the nose, but becomes increasingly pleasant in the course of the tasting. Sweet-spicy notes quickly break through the thick smoke. Vanilla, caramel, delicate sherry notes, red fruits and lime abrasion mingle with malt, iodine, maritime aromas and spicy oak notes. The nose is powerful and multi-faceted.The Laphroaig starts first with a pleasant texture (creamy, oily) before countless my taste buds are confronted with sweet-fruity smoke and abundant oak cargo. A subtle sherry sweetness, dark fruits, orange peel, vanilla, caramel and echoes of dark forest honey follow. Immediately behind it appear slowly maritime notes, iodine, lime abrasion and clear wood notes to the fore. A delicate bitterness is already noticeable on the palate. The smoke (campfire & medical) is always present and emphasizes the intense taste.Medium to long, sweet-smoky and spicy. Also on the finish line dominates the intense smoke (campfire, slightly ashy and medically). A slight residual sweetness flashes in the short term and is quickly replaced by strong woody notes. Maritime notes and licorice let the Laphroaig slowly fade away. On the palate remains a delicate dryness and a noticeable bitterness."
5540,Laphroaig Triple Wood,"Since you can not complain at all. Great drum combination that forms a slightly different Laphroaig. No high flyer, but top prize and: non-chill filtered.Strong peat smoke and immediately wet, loamy soil and damp hay. Iodine and salt. Far less kelp / algae than you might be used to with Laphroaig. Fewer oceanic associations crowd up. Mentholisch fresh with traces of vanilla and honey.The peat smoke takes a while to unfold on the tongue. Before that, mild-seasoned wild herbs are first found, which quickly become bitter. Salmiak sets over it sharply, but is softened by honey and vanilla after some time. Old oak boards are heavy on the tongue.Medium-long and oily, with the ashes of a peat fire, oak, salt and recurring sal ammoniac."
5541,Laphroaig Triple Wood,"Earthy green peat, medicinal, hansaplast, cough sweets, ripe apple, sweet citrus, a slight note of heather honey and some dried gras/hay.Quite a mouthfull, dried and smoked grasses, medicinal, peat, some honied liquorice, a lemony sour sweetness, charcoal, some black pepper.Medium to long: only minimal sweetness remaining, lingering tobacco smoke, peppers, salted liquorice, charcoal and a bitter ashy tail end."
5542,Laphroaig Triple Wood,"Nice standard bottling with good value for money, especially in terms of drinking strength. However, I prefer the stronger and edgier ""Quarter Cask"" and when it comes to additional fruit flavors, I prefer the Brodir or the PX-Cask.Maritime, phenolic and slightly medicinal smoke. Typical Laphroaig. Campfire, damp plank, old shoe sole, gauze bandage, vanilla, cherry, oak spice. The alcohol is once again very well integrated.Powerful start and not alcoholic spicy, despite the slightly peppery start. Smoke, orange, old rag, cloves, delicate cherry with vanilla and white oak spice.Medium-long finish. What remains is some smoke, together with a strong honey sweetness and a little bit of acidity."
5543,Laphroaig Triple Wood,"I really like the comparison - made by Ruben from Whiskynotes - of this to the Lagavulin Distiller's Edition. There's a similar sense of enhancing sweetness and tamping down peat smoke without losing the core identity of the distillate. This is still medicinal, peppery, salty, and complex, but it tones down the sheer herbal intensity of the Quarter Cask (to say nothing of the 10 CS), augmenting it with dry, yet fruity Oloroso notes. This definitely plays in a league with the aforementioned Lagavulin DE and Ardbeg Uigededail, yet it clocks in at roughly half the price. In short: I love it, and the only thing that keeps this bottle from reaching a higher mark is a certain (but slight) lack of depth / age."
5544,Laphroaig Triple Wood,Good NAS whisky for a good price. But I would always prefer the 10s and above all the great Quarter Cask. And they are both even cheaper.
5545,Laphroaig Triple Wood,"All very good flavors and tastes, but they are a bit 'side by side', not integrated, and young and stormy and not balanced and harmonious.First campfire. Then work quickly through a fruity sweetness, possibly apple mustache. Then comes the smoke and bacon again. Then it smells like mown grass. Finally red apple, maybe also pear. With hand warmth becomes greasier, on the edge also a little vanilliger pipe tobacco and leather.The alcohol tingles on the tip of the tongue, then smoke and grill ash. The whole is supported by a slight sweetness.The smoke stays in your mouth forever! In addition, neat salt and slightly nutty. Very, very delicious!"
5546,Laphroaig Triple Wood,"If you expect a lot of sherry and bourbon sweetness from the Triple Wood, you are on the wrong track. There is a lot of smoke on the way, and the barrels have a lot of tannins - nothing for whimpering. Great Laphroaig with bums.medically fresh, slightly pungent, bitter vegetable, freshly cut grass, lime skin ... then charcoal, soot ... behind it a light caramel sweetnessthe smoke comes back vegetable-bitter (almost burnt plastic, bitter tablets) ... keeps in the balance with sweetness, honey, caramel ... then licorice, Kamillan - wooden board.rather long, smoky-dry-bitter, some licorice"

[March, 2014]  I had this dram during a ""Lowlands"" rarities tasting at Bonn.In my old rating system (ten scales that translate into WB points: 50 - 66 - 75 - 80 - 82,5 - 85 - 87,5 - 90 - 92,5 - 95) I scored it 80. My notes state a light and grassy profile with some astringent moments on the palate.  Nothing remarkable about it and I will certainly never buy and open a bottle to drink it...The colour is old gold and the nose offers a profile to forget with nothing more than sweet barley sugars and bitter grasses. Even if I sniff into the glass for hours I am not able to identify any further aromas, this nose is very simple and absolutely uninteresting.The taste is sugary sweet, sugary sweet and then it gets suddenly bitter from grassy-waxy flavours. But not that the two flavours combine (which were fine), it is just that it is first sweet and after that it gets bitter without the sweetness before. Very strange and not enjoyable, to be honest. Sorry folks, but I have to use the spittoon (why should I spent precious liver cells for such a drink?).The dram arrives warming but without any identifiable coating effect on my palate and the finish is accordingly short as a lightning with a minor bitter-drying ending (no, not from tannins - this is a rather plastic-alike impression which I do not like at all).

Distilled at the end of the 1980s and bottle in the year that yours truly became a Dad for the first time. By now, my eldest daughter has finished university and has a job. Just to give you some context. In my case, this was bottled literally half a lifetime ago.On the nose it is a textbook example of young Littlemill on white fruit, lemongrass, pineapple skins and mint. While it has a malty heart, it already flirts with some exotic fruit, but we are not on a tropical island yet.The arrival is soft and just not oily enough to speak of a good body.

In my old rating system (ten scales that translate into WB points: 50 - 66 - 75 - 80 - 82,5 - 85 - 87,5 - 90 - 92,5 - 95) I scored this 85.  My notes state a sweet and easy-to-drink dram without specific highlights.[December, 2018] To do a proper tasting note I have another sample tonight. It confirms my old notes with a nice old style nose and a rather unimpressive but easy-to-sip taste. Nothing special about it, except that it is a Littlemill...The colour is yellow gold and the nose offers a Traditional Scotch profile with some overripe fruits (cantaloupe, peaches, apples), barley sugars and waxy as well as chalky-mineral aromas. There are some spices too but the woods are rather shy here. All in all a rather unimpressive nose.The taste is (compared to the nose) rather unimpressive on sweet (mainly barley sugars) and bitter (tannins) flavours with some shy fruits and spices. This is easy to drink but not more. Water is not recommended as it just flattens the dram.The dram arrives warming but not coating on the palate with a minor drying feeling (metals). The finish is short and adds no new impression - just a minor drying moment pops up towards the end again (metals and tannins)."

In addition, but also beautiful caramel and coffee notes, which dressed in only 40%, also quite well come into their own.That reminds me a little.

That's what i remember too and a reason for me to never buy it again. There's some vanilla, very little fruit, over all i judged it as quit flat. This bottle was easy to find around the first decade of the 2000's and for a price between 30-40 euro's. So, before you pay the current auction prices for this one, make sure it's definitely fitting your taste."
5595,Littlemill 12-year-old  Lowland Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"I probably wouldn't want an interesting bottle, not now. But for the original price, I would probably say. And I actually enjoyed it a lot. It is different. Drinkable easier and a little weird.Carbonated water, honey, mirabelle jam. At 40%, it even stings the nose.Lighter malty, simple but pleasant. A little vanilla, and a little metallic, iron to blood.Short, a little bitter. Fresh herbs and metal."

Mouth: sweet and malty, relatively lively. Grains and Ovaltine, caramel, the whole becoming a little sluggish and, well, flattish. Finish: shortish, very caramelly and quite sugary.

This is a pleasant surprise that's best to let sit in a glass for a while, as that tones down the poster glue and varnish note. A whisky style all its own, it's nice to see the character show as strongly as it does even in this humble 12yo.At first, glueish, with poster glue and unfinished wood. A cheap old chessboard. I don't know if it's because this stuff has been in the bottle for 15 years, but these woodcraft aromas are mellow, and not at all as annoying as you'd think. Something leafy, a tiny bit of baby sick, warm white bread, onions, dry herbs, and blackpepper.Gluey at first, but 15 minutes helps. Leafiness, spiciness. An oily, full body that doesn't exactly feel like 40 %. A bit of citrus, and then a sweetness that I can't place, but a friend said could be sherry cask influence.Pears, with a metallic tang that lasts a while."

Granted, stone bottles are tricky, and I know many a Springbank or Highland Park collector who’re lamenting the loss of quite a few cls of whisky, due to evaporation. Right, litres. But sometimes, these flagons just behave like glass bottles, I don’t know why. Perhaps the glazing on the inside? Better stoppers? Better environments? Or bottles that were not stored on their sides because some stupid presentation cases stupidly designed by stupid people were suggesting that was the way, like with many Cognacs? Bah, let’s simply check this one and see whether it got stale or not…Colour: amber. Nose: hold on, isn’t this old rum? Or even old agricole from Martinique? Because I’ll tell you what, had I nosed this blind, that’s what I’d have written. Sugarcane juice, delicate raisins, clay, camphor, old mint liqueurs, embrocations, patchouli, tiger balm, menthol, tarry ropes, aromatic herbs (sage, rosemary)… And more and more clay. It’s not too strong (anymore?), I don’t think it needs water. Mouth: what not strong! This is firm and amazingly assertive (indeed, love that word), wonderfully herbal – old-chartreuse-herbal – and just, well, powerful. Old mint liqueurs, glazed ginger, cinchona, wheelbarrows of bitter oranges, pinesap, honeydew, marzipan, a touch of tapenade (crushed olives and anchovies)… In fact I find this glorious. I hope this kind of complexity will never be lost, not particularly talking about Littlemill here. Finish: long, saltier, even kind of coastal, sappy, almondy… And we’re finding more bitter oranges in the aftertaste. Comments: it was the big question, could Littlemill be as great as the last vintages in the older days? Most old OBs used to answer ‘nope’ (5, 8, 12, 17…) but I have to say this 30 years old was just superb. I’m so glad I could taste it, thanks Angus! SGP:462 - 93 points"

""), and yet this one is only the 3rd official (after the 12 years and the 25 years) that I taste . And he is completely in the usual markers that I know and love. It's very good all the time. Too bad the price is prohibitive and prohibitive.Immediately, I recognize Littlemill and what I like in the products of this distillery: basket of white fruits and yellow cut fine and juicy. Hyper fruity all along, and hyper greedy. A very light floral and sweet malted cabbage in the background, but they struggle to compete with the fruity that dominates everything.Here too, it continues. Fruit on every floor, always juicy and greedy. In syrup, compote, in all the greedy and sweet forms. A fine pinch of spicy plant after a while, slightly green, which brings a bit of freshness.The fresh and menthol plant is more assertive at this level. The fruity remains, nevertheless, always well present. Dry malt sneaks too."

Finish: Long - very herbaceous and tart with a light fruit base and some oak. Now salty and green, fresh notes of eucalyptus, lemon balm, sage and peppermint.

It is fruity, sweet, smooth, a bit spicy in taste and finish and then slightly oaky. Overall a really pleasant experience.91 points from my point of view. You can get comparable Littlemill bottlings from independent bottlers at a more reasonable price though, but surely they don't come with all the prestige added to the bottle.

5648,Littlemill 25-year-old  Private Cellar Edition,"Littlemill 25 yo (50.4%, OB, 1500 decanters, 2015) Four stars A fairly new official Littlemill by the new owners, bottled under the ‘Annual Release’ series. It’s a blend of the 1989 and 1990 vintages, 10 casks altogether, finished in 1st fill oloroso. Which might, in truth, be a bit scary… Colour: deep gold. Nose: the sherry speaks first, with a slightly oxidative style, some walnuts, a little tobacco, some bitter chocolate… Littlemill’s usual topical style remains a little muted, but you do ‘hear’ it if you listen hard. With water: improves a lot, with lovely whiffs of damp earth, mushrooms, and more walnuts. I like walnuts. Also a little leather, and oranges that are starting to sing louder. Mouth (neat): it is a pleasant combination of tart citrusy fruits and very tobacco-ish notes from the sherry. Pipe tobacco (not too dark) and tangerines, grapefruits and passion fruits (touches). Good body, and despite the finishing, it hasn’t quite lost the distillate’s original freshness. With water: quite some wood extracts, around menthol and pine sap. Perhaps a touch of wild thyme and even rosemary, which is ‘funny’. Finish: rather long, perhaps a tad drying now. Strong black tea and liquorice wood (flavoured with menthol). Comments: perhaps not one of these bright fruity Littlemills, but I find it more than good. Only the price may be a little less sexy, I’ve seen it at $2,628.95 (no typo) at The Whisky Barrel.

And publish their finding, of course. Ianswered to the call and lo and behold: I got a 5cl miniature for thisLittlemill Flash Blog. Quite the opportunity if you consider that the newbottle will cost 2.700 EUR which is (way, way) beyond my budget. And let us behonest: this is Littlemill! The new Private Cellar Edition is only 1.500bottles strong. It is a vatting of ten casks from 1989 and 1990, finished onoloroso sherry casks. The packaging is very luxurious, but then with such aprice tag, that should be a given. The nose is not astropical as I would have hoped, but nevertheless grand. Candied oranges,walnuts and chewing tobacco come first, followed by some dark chocolate andfreshly coated leather. Some passion fruit, pink grapefruit and mandarin. Yes,leave it to breath for a few minutes and it becomes very fruity indeed. On the palate, thetobacco comes first. Quite pleasant. Some mint underneath. Again thecitrusfruit from the nose appears (mandarin, grapefruit and oranges), butfresher than expected. It can hide its age well, this is very lively. Midpalatethe wood shines through with a hint of black tea. The finish iswonderfully long, but does turn a bit dry now. But that is okay. It is not aparty pooper. Again a fantasticLittlemill, although it is not the best I have ever had. It is the mostexpensive, though. Thank you, Steve from the Whisky Wire, for this opportunity."
5650,Littlemill 25-year-old  Private Cellar Edition,"Well, yes, anyway! It's good, it's undeniably mastered and well done. But decidedly, I still prefer all Littlemill completely matured in bourbon casks. Spices too marked at times does not allow it, in my opinion, to reach 90.A floral / herbaceous entrance quite present, covering raisin and caramel sticky. Sherry casks announce the color: it will be greedy! Blond tobacco, and orange with hazelnut grow later.Fresh and suave, even slight tendency. Alcohol is perfectly controlled, I would believe it even lower. Raisin and sweet spices mixed with citrus acid drops. And at the bottom of it all, a very fine freshness that oscillates between menthol and fir sap.Long. An explosion of peppery spices, old dry wood that dries the mouth. The tangy and spicy grapefruit endures, sometimes accompanied by very sweet vanilla."

It also has a lovely grassy element and some nice floral notes (rose petals), followed by hints of raspberry candy cane and honey. Top notch.Creamy and full-bodied, and yes, it does have that classic Littlemill profile again. The cardboard makes an encore, as do the fruits, now with a more intense sweetness, courtesy of caramel and fudge notes, yet also with a citrus-like tartness.

5654,Littlemill 30-year-old,"Littlemill 30 yo (38.5%, OB, Edinburgh crystal decanter, 75cl, +/-1985?) Five stars We’re starting with this very rare and very old expression for one obvious reason, its very low strength. It’s from a square decanter and was most probably distilled in the 1950s. Colour: dark amber. Nose: it’s a sherried version and I think it’s absolutely impossible to detect any Littlemillness, such is the casks’s influence. We’re very much in cognac territories, but there are also sides that remind me of some old Macallans, which cannot be bad news. So old polished woods with touches of thuja and camphor, then roasted nuts and raisins, apricot pie and then hints of pinewood. Artisan strawberry jam. It’s a very lovely nose, obviously a little ‘antique’, and certainly not worn out. Could as well have been 40% vol. No, 43%. Mouth: sure it’s no big fat whisky, but it’s still filling your mouth, with some soft tannins that offset the lightness. A feeling of very old Sauternes wine, juicy golden raisins, three drops of yellow chartreuse that echo the pinewood, some cinnamon cake, a little praline, marmalade, blood oranges… It tends to lose steam but never nosedives, so you don’t feel frustrated. Finish: not that short! Sure it’s a little drying (cinnamon) but everything remains lovely and balanced. Raisins with a little cough syrup. A little gingerbread. Comments: I have to say this is a lovely surprise, I had thought this baby would be flat and, well, dead. But a low ‘cask’ strength and a low ‘reduced’ strength aren’t quite the same thing, are they?

5670,Inchmoan 12-year-old  Smoke and Spice,"Loch Lomond Inchmoan 12 years, 46% alc. Original bottling. Expansion: American oak Nose: dirty smoky. Cowshed and wet dog fur, a little plastic. After the first impression, the smoke becomes gentler and more maritime, some fish over a campfire on the beach and directly behind it vanilla, a lot of vanilla, the whisky is getting sweeter and sweeter. Add lobster with a squeeze of lemon. Palate: Strong and powerful, a lot of peat smoke and tar. In addition, a light herbal aroma, iodine and lemon zest. I have to think about lobster and other seafood again. The taste is rounded off by a very mild pepper note. Finish: Long and very smoky with peat, ash and campfire.

5671,Inchmoan 12-year-old  Smoke and Spice,"Inchmoan is a new style of peat to me, which somehow reminds me of wet wood. It has some charm, although the 2018 version of the 12 years old Inchmoan (wb id 97304) was more convincing to me, especially on the nose. I tried them both during the same tasting session.Relatively light peat with musty wet wood and pine needles. On the background there's some lemon and mineral notes. Nice, but not too expressive.Medium peat with liquorice, vanilla, citrus fruits and a bit of caramel. Also a bit mineral, with developing black pepper.Medium, not too heavy peat again. Some caramel, pear and the minerality of the palate. No further development."

5677,Inchmurrin 12-year-old  Island Collection,"[May, 2017]  I just did a private tour of Loch Lomond distillery, one of the very last sites I have not been in the stillhouse so far.  The tour was done very professionally by Ibon and clarified a lot of my questions about this fascinating distillery that produces so many different styles of whisky under one roof.  So this is a good reason to do some reviews of their current product range. Inchmurrin is the unpeated malt whisky that is distilled in the very special Lomond style stills (they call it the Inchmurrin stills, of course) at Loch Lomond distillery.  In their necks 17 different copper plates are installed at various positions that allow different cut-off points during distillation.  For the production of this Inchmurrin malt they cut-off once at traditional 63-68% for a more fruity and oily spirit as well as at unusual 83-85% for a more grassy, peppery and floral distillate.The nose is exactly this combination of fruity (green apples, peaches) and grassy (summer floral) aromas imbedded in a sweet and light wooden structure.  The mouthfeel is slightly peppery and a little adstringent (cold ashes, not unpleasant).  On the palate a barley sugary and fruity profile developes with some nutty and spicy notes.  The finish is of medium length, sweet and not drying at all.  An easy-to-drink dram without noticeable off-notes that (in my view) substantially improved compared with earlier releases.  Surprisingly good for such a standard edition..."
5678,Inchmurrin 12-year-old  Island Collection,"I like, neat, tasty, not arbitrary, with 35-40 € in the green area, good standard bottling.

5680,Inchmurrin 12-year-old  Island Collection,"Orchard fruits, slightly dank tropical fruits, oranges, vanilla flavoured yoghurt milk (on the nose), subtle spices.

5688,Inchmurrin 18-year-old  Island Collection,"Nasally, this malt is still relatively interesting, if a bit strange ;-)  The taste of this malt reminds me of a German whisky thanks to the dominant wet grain note. I don't want to bad-mouth this bottling, but it didn't suit my taste ...  22/21/21/22 (86 P)  Thanks for the experience, but the malt really wasn't as bad as you might think!Light amber shines in the glass, an indefinable fruit note arises from the Premium Snifter. Furniture polish? Fermented fruits? Sweet and oddly strange, but not bad in terms of basic character ... Cereal notes? Malt? Somehow it smells of cereal grains swollen in water ... A slight glue note is released, a hint of vanilla, hardly any fruit flavors ... Nasal I would almost guess a German whisky.The first sip flows mildly with a harsh grain note on the tongue. Tart fruit and wood aromas stick to the palate, the second sip appears pale and reserved. To be honest, I can't get anything from this malt, it lacks expression and character. Zest and orange and lemon peel, again cereals swollen in water come to my mind. There is minimal sharpness, with slightly tart wood tones it is then already in the aftertaste.Slightly tart, malty, minimally dark fruit and light citrus zest. Of course, the grain notes so often mentioned come into play again ..."

5692,Inchmurrin 18-year-old  Island Collection,"A good whisky made by Loch Lomond. Not a whisky which will suit everyone. If you like their style (and I do) this is a good one to drink as a daily dram.A very full flavoured nose. Quite some unique notes. This is Loch Lomond as it should be. Raw, earthy and not for beginners. Behind all this there are apples and pears. Some more exotic canned fruits can be found too. And a little touch of citrus. But after a while some more bourbon notes as caramel and vanilla come in.Full bodied. Sweet and sour arrival. Hint of sugar, some spices, quite some fruitiness again. Orchard fruits. Ripe melon. Again with some time and air it gives more bourbon matured notes.Medium-long length. A tad bitter though. Loads of bourbon vanilla and ice cream. A little fruitiness is in the background."

5694,Inchmurrin 18-year-old  Island Collection,"Most prefer to say ""interesting"" or ""unique"" to explain a whisky they generally don't enjoy. All I will say, if there were more whiskies like this I might start drinking something else.Very bizarre nose, it hits you with a lot of everything. You get some honey notes, also a touch of the oak, there is some grassiness and floral elements as well. Now onto the weird stuff... there's a slight vegetal aroma, even something resembling paint? Some wood chips and maybe even a little gasTruly bizarre.....On arrival its a tad musky, even something sweaty about it. It has some sharpness, plenty of spice, something tastes off about it, think of smelly old socks. Cardboard and again with the vegetal notes. The longer you hold on the palate the more bitterness that starts to come through. Generally just sour and bordering on foul.Finish is woody, even a little hint of ash and soft smoke. There's some heat as well. On the long side with bitterness from the oak."
5695,Inchmurrin 18-year-old  Island Collection,"Decent dram but falls a bit short in terms of flavor to its direct in-house competitor LL 18 in my opinion. So if you have to choose you might want to revert to the latter. Or even better, try both and then make an informed decision. ;-)"
5696,Inchmurrin 18-year-old  Island Collection,"Loch Lomond has a distinctive distillery character which I slowly become familiar with. It isn't an 'easy' distillate, but they can be very entertaining. This Inchmurrin is a good example, it's a solid dram!Interesting nose with both a fruity component (pineapple, citrus fruits) and a dusty/earthy component. Some pepper and a grainy note (I know, it is a malt whisky).Rather full bodied. Papaja, apple treacle, rose water and a hint of vanilla. Then more earthy and oaky, with a subtle but distinctive note of wood smoke.Spicier finish with ginger and pepper. It's also eathy, with mushrooms popping up. Some apple, coffee and articifical sweetener round it off."
5697,Loch Lomond 12-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"The core range of Loch Lomond brings a nice diversity of whiskies to the table. I’m quite a fan of their whiskies and in my opinion it’s underrated. This Loch Lomond 12 is no exception.Very recognizable Loch Lomond profile. The more intens brother of the Inchmurrin 12yo. On the nose it gives a more full body with a lot of ripe pear, apricot, pencil shavings, subtle wood spices, charred oak and a whiff of dried lavender. Very accessible and pleasant nose. A very deserving whisky despite of it’s age.Bittersweet. Herbal-like and fruitpeels. Mouthfeel is a little like the peel of a pear. Further more tea notes. Several spices and and grassy herbs. Friendly for the palate all the way. It does need a little hand warmth first. When this whisky is a little to cold, there is a little disturbing sourness to it. When heated up a little bit, this disolves.Again a very recognizable Loch Lomond flavors. More woody parts play a bigge role here. I get melon, kiwi and rooibos tea."
5698,Loch Lomond 12-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"I struggle a bit to get excited about Loch Lomond.This is a lot better than the NAS Original.I would happily accept it as a gift, but doubt if I would buy it.Sweet barley. Very ripe citrus.Some smoke with a tiny hint of peat to it.Pencil lead and cardboard.Pear juice and a single rasberry.Sweetish, but not as fruity as the nose.Caramel with some allspice.One dimentional and rather simple.Not bad, but not particularly interesting.Just the main components fading rapidly.A little dry, a little bitter... gone.The smell from the empty glass is what I find best about it."

Loch Lomond single malt is in fact a vat of several malts produced by the different pot stills at Loch Lomond distillery.  It is a batch of around 40 to 60 per cent peated and unpeated malts distilled in the very special Lomond style stills that produce the Inchmurrin single malt too plus the respective 60 to 40 per cent unpeated malt distilled in traditional pot stills within the same stillhouse.  All malt matures in both freshly re-charred and refilled american hogsheads.  The peat is sourced from a place nearby Peterhead and has highland characteristics (contrary to the more maritime and medical seaside peat that is used for Islay malts).The nose is very sweet both on barley sugars and honey with some hints of fruits (pears, peaches).  It arrives smooth and warming in the mouth but coats just the upper part of the tongue.  The body is sweet and fruity as the nose promised with some additional toffee notes added.  The finish is of medium length and adds no new impressions.  Another easy-to-sip dram from this underrated distillery that in my view significantly improved compared to earlier releases..."

5703,Loch Lomond 12-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"After a lineup of Loch Lomond whiskies, I'm ready to upgrade my score for this one by 1 point. It's a nice dram for the price point. I had a chance to taste a 12yo refill cask version next to it, and I thought it was more complex and less sweet. They tell me their bourbon casks come from Heaven Hill and Jim Beam.Quiet tar candy notes are pretty much all you hear from the peat in it. Otherwise it's on fruit candy (gummy bears or worms), linen, some oak that's already gone past the ""young wood"" aromas, with a faintly buttery, faintly chalky undercurrent. After a while in the glass I start to find a note of boiled eggs.An oily, firm body. Vanilla and some tar candy mixed with these candy fruit flavors that are mostly on white or green gummy bears. The body really feels like 46 %, no flabbiness there. No off notes to be found, but not much complexity either.Some metallic touches, but mostly the finish is on the fruit candy sweetness."

5706,Loch Lomond 12-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,
5707,Loch Lomond 14-year-old,"Another positive surprise. This is my second favorite LL bottling after the 17 y.o. ""Organic"".Really well done, and affordable as well.Very pleasant, full of ripe citrus fruits, creamy ex-bourbon sweetness and intense, but elegant spices. Fragrant, floral, and softly herbal. Lots of caramelized wood sugars, vanillin, muscovado. Somewhere in the background, there's this musty, funky, lactic, slightly cheesy note that LL sometimes displays, but it's very manageable. With time (and especially once the first sip has gone down the hatch), the fruits come out more. Really nice fruit + spice combo!Dry and woody at first, then comes the sweetness (créme caramel), while the third act belongs to French oak spices and a veritable rush of fruits: jackfruit, mango, pineapple, lychee... I have to say I'm impressed: such a late burst of tropical fruit is usually the domain of high-quality Irish pot still whiskies, really old Speysiders, or the better Bowmores, and this budget bottling does a surprisingly good job of imitating that experience at a fraction of the price.Softly fading fruit flavors, a muted mustiness, crisp oak spice and a touch of wood smoke. Totally works."
5708,Loch Lomond 14-year-old,"Dense sugar plum malt, dark brown sugar, baking spices, savory, light peat, white pepper. This has a unique malty character and goes from sweet to savory all in one sip. I quite like it"
5709,Loch Lomond 14-year-old,"Very fruity and 'conventional' for a regular Loch Lomond. It lacks the mossy and dusty 'wet wood' notes I encounter in many Loch Lomonds. Solid dram for its friendly price.Starts classic with malt sugars, baked apples, citrus fruits and cut flowers. Then some dusty notes and yogurt kicks in.Citrus fruits, apples, vanilla and a hint of tropical fruit, followed by a slightly sparkling mouthfeel of 7up or mineral water.Citrus fruits, raspberry and vanilla prelude spices and a slight nuttiness. There's some white wine too, with a hint of woody smoke in the end."
5710,Loch Lomond 14-year-old,"The aroma contains caramelized red apples, unripe strawberries with menthol. The sweet and sour taste is dominated by strawberries with cream, apricot jam and fresh wood cut. The finish is medium in length, sweet, strawberry-peppery. The barrel is very nice here, in some kind of garden berries, menthol freshness, very good balance and the right degree, nice. RATING: 86pts - | 83 - 86 (B) → Good | - Not a “must”, but a nice-to-have."
5711,Loch Lomond 14-year-old,"Head to head with the 18 yo. Better balance here and none of the sour and musty off notes I get from the 18.Initially a bit closed and cramped up but opens up nicely with a few drops of water. Dried and cooked fruits, somewhat musty and slightly floral, dried apricot, cooked apple, sugarbread, cola bottle sweets, a mild sour white wine note, sawdust in the background.Dried apricot, some apple, slight peach, bitter citrus, bitter and dusty wood notes, white pepper nutmeg and cloveShort to medium: sweeter and fruitier than nose and taste with vanilla, honey, pineapple, and grapefruit fades into subtle musty and bitterish wood notes."
5712,Loch Lomond 14-year-old,For € 27.95 completely ok.
5713,Loch Lomond 14-year-old,"When the nose opens up, you get some lovely notes. The nose is quite fruity, which is slightly less in the taste where the spices take over. However, I do not like the finish, it's quite bitter and has too many woody notes. That’s a pity. But all in all not a bad dram at all.This one is a bit restrained at first. Then it becomes somewhat fruity, with notes of oranges and dried plums. A hint of apricots too. There’s a wood note in the back, which is followed by cinnamon. Later also vanilla.Quite some caramel. Toffee. Apples. Honey sweetness. A hint of tropical fruits. Grapefruit. Quite some cinnamon here, cloves and a pinch of black pepper. A light oak note.Short to mid-long, a bit dry and one-dimensional. Bitter. Cinnamon. Caramel. Black pepper and oak."

5718,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Fruit and Spice,"Blind Tasting: July 2021A typical distillation character in combination with a sweetness and cooked fruits what we usually call a bland aroma, but here in a good sense.The bland aroma permeates the taste along with cooked vegetables. After a while some citrus tones. Cereal taste that are prominent throughout the body.Short, with some sweet licorice, mild pepper and a little smoke in the background."
5719,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Fruit and Spice,"Loch Lomond; a not very popular distillery. You do not see them on the shelves at Schiphol airport. It is what it is! But ever since I visited Loch Lomond distillery with my friends, I started to get more than average interested in their bottlings.Impressive thick nose. Full of butter and vanilla. Without a shadow of the doubt; this is the LL signature.Soft, again thick, creamy and full body. A tad smoky; but very light. Mild spices; all well balanced. 46% abv is very ok. It does not need to be more; but a lower abv would have made it weaker.Medium long. Wood, spices and a touch of smoke in the finish."
5720,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Fruit and Spice,They did well with this one. Having had the Inchmoan 18 a while back I was pleasantly surprised that this LL 18 beats that one in my book. Looking forward to compare it to the quite (European) oak-heavy LL 14 on of these days. Good bank for the buck.
5721,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Fruit and Spice,"Very drinkable - this dram goes fast :-) Nose and taste are very balanced. Finish isn't really my thing - there is something weird there (and the finish is rather short too). But overall this is a great dram! Enjoyed tasting this!The nose is sweet with honey, grains, sweet malt, pear and a bit of sour apples. In my opinion the nose is the best! It has some prumes (maybe in combo with the sour apples). I seem to be missing the smoke... But there is something faint earthy (basement).The taste is good! Tannines and something beerlike (barley, malty). The mouth dries out a bit. Apple again (but not sour anymore). Even a bit creamy. At the back I taste something like grapefruit-peel and then some balanced sweets again.The finish is rather short; something I did not expect. I have oak, young wet wood, even some pencil chips and a touch of tobacco. Although these tasting-tones seem to be very nice, the real life combo isn't a 100% my thing. The finish disappointed me a bit."
5722,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Fruit and Spice,"Loch Lomond 18 years, 46% alc. Original bottling (2020). Expansion: American oak barrels Nose: Very slightly smoky with different tobacco and pleasant fruit aromas. Pears, mirabelle plums, slightly unripe plums and tart apples, peaches. In addition, green tea and cigars, perhaps cedar wood and a bit of mushy banana. Also slightly musty aromas, like in a damp cellar. Palate: Oily and very intense, the fruit aromas are still present, still slightly tart with crumbly apples, watermelon and grapefruit, tobacco and a lot of tea. There is also mild ginger and a slightly stronger note of pepper, as well as a little nutmeg. Finish: very long, wood smoke, tobacco and a bit of fruit. The oak wood is present, slightly tingling with nutmeg and pepper. Conclusion: A really nice whisky with a wonderful aroma profile.

5726,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Fruit and Spice,"Beautiful Loch Lomond with noticeably older age. Very tart and with strong oak tones. Still not intrusive or even superimposed. Tobacco and tea leaves are mentioned in the official notes. I underline that too. A strong, bitter dram. I like it."
5727,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Good nose, less attractive on the palate.A slight alcoholic waft carrying boozy fruits, akin to lychee liqueur or plum wine. As the stated age demands, there are also some ""old"" notes to be found: furniture polish, waxed leather. Pickled gherkins. Shares a creamy aspect with the 12-year-old version: stracciatella or tiramisu comes to mind. However, there's also some mortar, wet cement, and a bit of cardboard. Perhaps still somewhat idiosyncratic and not top-notch per se, but really interesting and not un-complex at all. After the first sips, some soft smoke becomes palpable.Soft, silky, then increasingly spicy (new wood)? Soapy, with a bitter edge. The fruits only appear after the first drop has gone down; then peaches and tangerine surge up, with some bitter grapefruit following in their wake. I had expected more wackiness after the nose. A bit unexpressive, even ""neutral"" at times.An artificial, aspartamy sweetness paired with lovage. Something soapy and musty as well. Not its best feature. Medium length."
5728,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Man, I bought this for $95AUD, I don't understand the low score and all the complaints. At that price, it's damn fine whisky. Give it time and patience. It delivers. Great range of flavours. Good balance of sweet, sour, bitter. Intense flavour. Good development. Long finish. This is good value. And it's a singular style, it's got character. This is satisfying and easy on the wallet. Of course, it's not perfect or outstanding by any means, and granted I'd prefer it without the fake tan, but an underrated malt nevertheless. Don't listen to the pervasive dogma about what's good and what's lousy. Follow your own damn nose and palate."
5729,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Imho underrated because of previous LL bottlings and distillery's notoriety for distilling off notes like stewed vegetables. Certainly a lot has improved in recent years. While not a perfect malt and still somewhat distinct which I appreciate, this is a solid malt with a solid price / performance ratio! Maybe try a sample?!"

5731,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"[May, 2017]  I just did a private tour of Loch Lomond distillery, one of the very last sites I have not been in the stillhouse so far.  The tour was done very professionally by Ibon and clarified a lot of my questions about this fascinating distillery that produces so many different styles of whisky under one roof.  So this is a good reason to do some reviews of their current product range. Loch Lomond single malt is in fact a vat of several malts produced by the different pot stills at Loch Lomond distillery.  It is a batch of around 40 to 60 per cent peated and unpeated malts distilled in the very special Lomond style stills that produce the Inchmurrin single malt too plus the respective 60 to 40 per cent unpeated malt distilled in traditional pot stills within the same stillhouse.  All malt matures in both freshly re-charred and refilled american hogsheads.  The peat is sourced from a place nearby Peterhead and has highland characteristics (contrary to the more maritime and medical seaside peat that is used for Islay malts).The nose is on a sweet honey and  grassy (summer floral) profile with some hints of toffee, milk chocolate and sherry.  The mouthfeel is peppery but not coating at all.  The palate shows a fine sweetness with flavours of oranges, bitter chocolate and toffee again.  The finish is of medium length and comes nicely in several waves over your tastebuds - it gets even more fruitier in the end.  No bitter or drying notes at all and no peaty flavours (that I could find).  To me this is the best edition of their current product range and a substantial improvement compared with earlier releases.  Unfortunately they increased the price accordingly, making it less attractive this way..."
5732,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"It has been aged up and has matured in all the ways you would expect: adding richness and depth - exchanging fresh for cooked fruits and layering of the ""expensive"" notes to the existing profile.However, it appears that I just don't like the Loch Lomond distillate, no matter what you do to it. That metallic taste is worse than in the 12. It sticks to my palate more persistently than raw garlic. I've eaten half a melon, a bag of chips and a pickled beetroot in my ongoing (and so far, unsuccessful) quest to dislodge it from my afflicted taste buds. I guess this is my life now.There's actually quite a lot to like here, but it's lucky I wrote it down before the tail hit, because I fear everything I eat or drink from here on out will taste like AA batteries.I didn't finish the 3oz sample and now I have a headache.The same orchard fruits as the 12 but now cooked with butter and demerara sugar. Bees wax furniture polish, leather, cognac and cigar smoke. This smells like it might be expensive.Inhaling slightly as a take my first sip, I get a mouthful of icing sugar, then the profile broadly follows the same pattern as the 12: confectionery fruit sweetness, followed by shotgun blast of chili ginger that again devolves into cigar ash buttered crumpets and candied citrus peel.The ash and bitter fruit peel keep growing and then morph into dark chocolate covered coffee beans. And that metal taste is still *&!@ing there and *and won't go away*."
5733,Loch Lomond 18-year-old  Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"A kind of closed whisky, reminiscent of a shy, closed, taciturn, but at the same time diligent student.

5747,Loch Lomond Signature  Blended Scotch Whisky,"[May, 2017]  I just did a private tour of Loch Lomond distillery, one of the very last sites I have not been in the stillhouse so far.  The tour was done very professionally by Ibon and clarified a lot of my questions about this fascinating distillery that produces so many different styles of whisky under one roof.  So this is a good reason to do some reviews of their current product range. This single blended whisky is composed of mainly 4-5 year old whiskies all produced by the different stills of Loch Lomond distillery.  These are traditional grain whiskies made of around 90 per cent wheat and 10 per cent malted barley and distilled in large Coffey stills at a detached building + single grain whisky made from 100 per cent malted barley and distilled in a small pair of Coffey stills located in the same stillhouse as the pot stills + malt whisky produced in very special Lomond stills with 17 plates installed at different places in the stills neck to allow variable cut-off points + malt whisky produced in very traditional pot stills.  These whiskies mature in both freshly re-charred and refilled bourbon casks before vatted and finished in an oloroso solera process. The nose is quite light on grassy grainy and some sherry aromas.  Not so much of the malt here, just some hints of barley sugars.  The arrival on the palate is smooth with some peppers developing later.  The taste is again very smooth and adds some more malty flavours to the mix, notably chocolate and nutty aromas.  The finish is short and sweet, now the barley sugars are much more present.  All in all a nice blend for all that love light and easy-going drams without spikes and ""oompf"".  Not too bad..."

5759,Loch Lomond Single Grain  Peated,"It is of course not really a grain whisky because it’s made from barley. But because it’s distilled in a Coffey still, the SWA doesn’t allow it to be called a single malt.It’s quite an unusual peated whisky, but it’s only ok. Somewhat on the spirit-like side too. Definitely interesting to taste once, but I wouldn’t buy a bottle of this myself.Peat at first which is slightly medicinal it seems, leaning towards bandages and a touch of iodine. Fresh lemons and unripe pears. A hint of vanilla. It’s a little bit grassy at some point too. Gooseberries. A touch of icing sugar and a pinch of cinnamon.Peat on the arrival.

5810,Macallan 12-year-old  Triple Cask Matured - Fine Oak,"RaisinsWhen Macallan introduced the Fine Oak – more than a decade ago now – this caused something of an earthquake. Until then Macallan’s claim to fame was the fact that they matured exclusively on sherry oak, but with the Fine Oak series the use of bourbon casks was introduced. No, some ten years later, a new Fine Oak series was launched, albeit Triple Cask Matured. And as the name suggests the whisky is matured on three types of oak: bourbon casks and both American and European sherry seasoned casks.The nose is very soft and accessible on sweet malt, honey and oats with just a hint of orange marmalade and raisins. Some almond paste and cinnamon.The body is just fine and the malt is mildly spicy on cinnamon, cloves and some aniseed. But the fruit now evolves towards the candied variety. The raisins shine above all else.The finish is just a bit longer than short, but offers nothing new.Good entry level malt of this famous house at a fair price. Every man’s friend, but that’s okay.

5818,Macallan 15-year-old  Fine Oak - Triple Cask Matured,"What a disappointment, with this new bottling, Macallan takes another step in the wrong direction.  Although there is now an age indication, the whisky seems properly overhydrated. The fine oak spicy aromas and the beautiful light fruitiness of the old fine oak bottlings are hardly present here. This whisky is totally interchangeable, uncharacteristic of Macallan or, rather, characteristic of Macallan's bottling policy of recent years. Sad, really sad. You should not even collect it. Just under 120 € is crazy for this quality."

5826,Macallan 15-year-old  Fine Oak - Triple Cask Matured,"Copy/pasteThis 15 years old Triple Cask Matured whisky from Macallan matured on American and European casks that were prepared with sherry as well as former bourbon casks. It’s the successor to the Fine Oak series and was (re)launched in 2018. Contrary to the younger brother (12), this one is bottled at 43%.The nose offers sweet malt, peach, almonds and a truckload of dark honey. Add a tea spoon of light brown sugar, candied ginger and the picture is complete. I suspect that Macallan not only used whisky that is three years older (doh!) but also that more sherry casks went into the mix. This is quite sexy on the nose.The body is good and the slightly higher ABV gives it some punch. Nicely sweet and spicy at the same time, but also a tad drying. The palate is a copy/paste of the nose. Only the drying element – as if I’m licking a leather pouch – is something I could have done without. But that’s nitpicking.The finish is medium long on sweetened tea and cloves, keeping your mouth entertained and warm.Let’s be clear: this is a good Macallan and merits it’s price tag of 100 EUR. Serve it to your guests and they will all be pleasantly surprised. A crowd pleaser, to say the least. Thanks, Timon, for a very generous sample. I was able to taste it three times. This crowd is pleased indeed."

Aroma has some orange, a little leafy, a suggestion of stove gas (unexpectedly), a boiled sweet found down the side of the sofa with some lint attached. Improves with air. Some oiliness to the body. Taste is easy, well-rounded, the oily body gives a greater impression of flavour than is actually there, I think. The taste is restrained, without a rough edge in sight, but really not very impactful. Yet the body helps the impression of richness and intensity. Very subtle impressions of citrus, pale wood, mixed dried fruit and rock salt. The flavour does build in intensity given time and it develops a pungent pepperiness … but it is always restrained, refined. Pretty well-constructed and enjoyable.

5850,Macallan Enigma  Quest Collection,"Oak DrivenThis Enigma – which means as much as ‘mystery’ – is part of the Quest Collection, exclusive to world travelers. The series consists of the Quest, Lumina, Terra and this Enigma. It matured on European first fill sherry casks. It does not happen often that one gets to taste Macallan that matured on casks that came from once source. In this case: Toneleria Tevasa, a cooperage in Jerez, Spain, specialized in ‘seasoned’ (prepared) casks for the Scottish whisky industry. This is my 40th encounter with this Speysider. Sturdy nose on yellow and red fruit (think apricots, mango, raspberry) with almond paste, hazelnuts and candied sugar. The wood – first fill, remember? – does put its foot down with wood shavings and spices and a drying element. Think ginger, nutmeg, menthol. A drop of rancio and some roast beef. I have to admit: I like it a lot.On the palate, I first get dark fruit (dates, raisins, candied apricots) before the oak kicks in. Once that happens, though, it’s big: drying, spicy on cloves, nutmeg, chili pepper and a truckload of cinnamon. Having said that: good balance and a nice mouth feel.The finish is medium long on more wood, but not disturbingly so.This one is what they call oak driven. But it works. I like it a lot. The price – around 250 EUR – not so much. But it does come in a nice box (sarcasm, anyone?)."
5851,Macallan Enigma  Quest Collection,Very fun and substantial Mac at good abv. Close to a sherry bomb. Intense sherry aromas but still good balance overall. Perhaps in the territory of old Dronach 15 and recent Dronach 18. No deal however due to Macallan premium pricing. Reminds me of the 1824 Series Ruby from a few years back.

5853,Macallan Enigma  Quest Collection,"Macallan Enigma 44.9%. Consumed October 2020. An outrageously dark pour. Hopefully natural. Amber brown is how it should be described. Very dark indeed. Held to light it has an orange hue. Aroma is pure sherry. Oloroso. Plasticky. Dates. Christmas pudding and fruit cake all the way. Yes Christmas pudding is by far the dominant vibe. I don't actually like Christmas pudding all that much but on the aroma here it is nostalgic and pleasant. Later on it gets meaty and cherryish, dry sherry. Taste is slightly rubbery, no alcohol showing up, more Christmas pudding, stupidly sherry cask, but not sweetly sherry from the wine and not tannic or bitter from the wood. I mean this is a good example of what I assume Macallan seeks to achieve. Not even a hint of a rough edge. It's pure silk. Not too fruity, it is sherry cask led without being too sherried or starting to taste like cognac rather than whisky. No particular impressions of sweetness or dryness - it lands squarely between the two and is seasoned by an impression of salt. I imagine that the best vintage Macallans that cost thousands upon thousands of pounds are somewhat like this. This is actually very good. The sherry is very authentic I'm certainly not getting the impression of seasoned casks, or at least only a subtle hint (and it seems that only seasoned casks were used). It has the maximum sherry cask character that you would want in a whisky before it became garish and obscene. I have had several disappointing experiences with expensive Macallan bottlings, but this was not one of them. I get a real impression of tasting old sherry cask Macallan here - like I now know what the white whale bottlings that reach six figure sums at auction are likely to taste like. 3.8/90"

Not sure if it was a huge success for this expression can still easily be found in shops.The nose is wonderfully aromatic with lots of sherry influences in the guise of nutmeg, cinnamon and caramelized nuts, orange oil and some banana flambéed. Lots of sweet malt, a hint of dark honey and dried fruits. But it is all so soft and friendly.On the palate the nuts and candied ginger come first, followed by milk chocolate, leather and raisins.

This has more depth, more complexity, more elegance, more herbs, peelings, green tea, flowers, bread… But it remains a little light and, well evanescent. Mouth: ah, more character! It’s even got a coastal side, with this funny blend of metal and seaweed, plus a very excellent phenolic side that’s sometimes to be found in older HPs or even Pulteneys. Herbal teas (I can think of rosehip and honeysuckle). Cauliflower dumplings. Very very good old style! Finish: a bit short again, and getting drier as often, but at least you’re remembering you just had some very good malt whisky. Comments: I’ll say it, this is a huge surprise.

5918,Mackmyra 10-year-old,"Can absolutely be seen and does not have to hide behind the Scottish colleagues. Nice thing, especially the varied and not too smooth nose in contrast to the tongue is fun.The scent of a wildflower meadow, with apples, pear purée and tangerines - and as a complement to make it not too sweet and pleasing, a little tree resin and the smell of a sunlit pine forest. Milk chocolate, Nesquik cocoa. In the background light maritime notes. Mineral, spicy, reminiscent in places of a young Springbank.To start on the tongue full of toffee, malt, chocolate and tart honey. A nice handle to the spice rack: juniper berries, rosemary, lovage, chervil.

5919,Mackmyra 10-year-old,"A perfect example of a middle of the road, everybody’s got to like it kind of whisky. No surprises, just whisky.

Easy accesible. dutch Candy called ‘salmiakdrop’.It is a big rough and not in the greatest balance yet. Turbulent I’d say. First it’s quite gentle, fat and even a little waxy. Right after that it becomes sharp and turns a little agressive. Water eases it down a bit. Green Herbs, baked apples, and a hint of perfumeShort. Slightly sharp initially but sweet and salty after. Again a hint of ‘salmiakdrop’. Lavender closes the game."
5920,Mackmyra 10-year-old,"Quite classic my faith, but well done, balanced, and consistent. Easy access, but does not revolutionize the world of whisky. To test.Well present, offering a mixture of fruits (apple and lemon mainly) and malt rather dry. Honey and vanilla bring sweetness, without obscuring the overall dryness of the nose. Green wood in abundance after aeration.Gentle and easy to access, without aggressiveness. A fruity acidulous and bitter mixture is needed. Apple, lemon peel. Malt is here too, without being too dry this time.Mirabelle liqueur sneaks, before giving way to bitter malt. The citrus acid is a little while, then a pinch of sweet spices is thrown on the tongue. Green wood in quantity appears at the very end of the course."
5921,Mackmyra 10-year-old,"Well, it's a success, I'm starting to imagine what it will look like with a five or ten year old version. (Whisky Passion)It is a fruit syrup that is first known. I would say apple in the form of cream. I had the opportunity to taste Mackmyra much younger and clearly this one is a level above. The malty style is a little erased, in favor of vanilla, honey. Ginger confit, slightly lemony.The whole is caramelized to perfection, creamy vanilla cream. New wood will make its appearance, without jostling the whole. Red fruits, blackcurrant and this kind of berries. Very flexible, well balanced and particularly mature. The share of Oloroso is present, sweet, with an orange flavor, yes sherry. Some spices, it's a balance number.Vive. There is a certain fruity acidity. Dry wood. It will warm up again, with spices, raisins."
5922,Mackmyra 10-year-old,"Mackmyra showed in the past that it's capable of making very friendly, fruity whiskies. This is no exception. It's very well balanced, with a perfect equilibrium of fruit, malt and spice. This first age statement whisky sets high expectations for the future.Thanks to the friendly people of Mackmyra for offering a sample.Very friendly, malty and fruity. Warm apple pie with raisins, lemon and cinnamon comes up first. Or would it be a strudel, with vanilla cream on top? Apart from that, there is plain malt, dough, The oak is noticeable, and gives a soft polish, saw dust and spicy nose.The attack is powerful, but fruity and spicy. There is a lot of yellow garden fruit, some lemon drops, field flowers, but certainly soft spices: cinnamon and white pepper. At the end, some grassy notes emerge.Medium long, and still estery: yellow fruit and flowers. Mild spices, cake dough, and cinnamon complete this joyful finish."
5923,Mackmyra 10-year-old,"More on: https://tomtrinkt.deVery complex fruitiness with floral notes, which evoke associations with a flowering flower meadow. So far I have noticed similar floral notes in the Hibiki Japanese Harmony. Primarily bright fruits like green apples, citrus fruits, pears and apricots are dominant during my first impression. Subtle sherry notes linger in the background. Strong vanilla, slightly kräutrige notes, grassy freshness (towards eucalyptus) and a more perceptible oak flavor complete the complex aromas.Full, powerful start with a pleasant, oily mouthfeel. Very sweet and fruity, especially in the front tongue area, but at the same time with a noticeable oak spice, which causes a slight tingle. Harmoniously tuned, as neither aroma spectrum (sweet & spicy) dominates the taste too much. Lemons, apples, some vanilla, dark chocolate and a hint of anise / clove crystallize out. The subtle Sherrynoten linger, as in the nose, in the background.Medium to long. Fruity, with distinct oak notes, herbs and some sherry. Slightly drier with a hint of bitterness."

5926,Mackmyra 10-year-old,"My first Swedish malt, not disappointing at all. Quite peculiar for its smooth vanilla nose and some oaky bitterness in the (slightly dry) aftertaste. Very light on the palate, yet interestingly textured and revealing a wide range of cereal flavours. Even if this is the only malt from this distillery having an age statement, it makes me curious to discover more of its expressions, as this one really seems packed with much skill and care. Well done, Mackmyra!"
5927,Mackmyra 10-year-old,"I think the nose is a bit ""messed up"" but it is interesting and diversified, also with a lot of depth. On the palate, however, it is a bit too harsh in places and has too much liquorice and coconut for my personal taste. Of the three Mackmyras I've tried so far, this one I like the least at first. I would have expected a little more settledness / balance when specifying the age, but when I think about it, I've also had other ten-year-olds who looked similar. Still very tasty drink.Apple, banana sauce and bread with raisins. Something dark, grainy and whole bread. Grassy. In places I perceive a component of which I am not entirely sure whether it is more youthful and harsh (metallic?) Or rather a mineral note for me. I think I can still find warming spices and a little pepper, as well as roasted aromas like coffee. With enough air, an aromatic, creamy-sweet wood spice flows out of the glass paired with concentrated, deep, full of fruit, which suddenly makes it appear much more ripe. Somehow I find the nose a bit ""messed up"" but overall appealing.ühl-mineral. At first a bit harsh / snappy, seems quite youthful to me. Vanilla, spicy sweetness. Becomes pudding-like and oatmeal-like full-bodied. At the same time it has a tart, tart side. Not quite as harmoniously balanced.Pebble licking. Young pear and green apple. Blackcurrant? Icing sugar sweet. Then it evolves towards spearmint chewing gum. Anise, liquorice and straw-like ginger in a combination and intensity that I find a little too much for me. After that he goes very much towards coconut and completely new wood. The mouth becomes increasingly dry. All of this on a foundation that somehow still seems like a fruity-pure new make to me in places. Not very long, but pleasant."

5943,Mackmyra Brukswhisky  Fourth Edition,"Mackmyra Brukswhiskey, 41.4% alc. Original bottling. Maturation: Bourbon barrels, sherry barrels, Swedish oak. Type: single malt whiskey Nose: restrained and very slightly smoky, a little creamy first impression. Unripe pear, a little tangerine and a little crème brulée. The smoke looks fresh and smells of charcoal, followed by banana mash, fennel and a hint of aniseed. Palate: stronger, slightly spicy. I notice rye bread and blood orange first, the smoke is barely noticeable. Instead, clearly caramel candies and some fudge, and again the banana together with pepper and ginger. Finish: Medium long, oily and flattering. The emphasis here is once again on slightly bitter citrus fruits, caramel and oak wood.

5969,Mackmyra MACK,"Not going to bother too much about the colour, because I believe it to have added colouring.On the nose: very sweet from the start. A lot of candy notes (wine gums, sugared apple juice), honeysuckle and fruity sweetnes with banana, blood oranges, sweet strawberries and jam/marmelade (apricot, perhaps even rhubarb), sweet dessert wine (muscat). After 10 or so minutes I picked up a faint wood note. All in all quite inviting yet at the edge of being overly sweet.On the palate again a sweet arrival, but also a bit of alcohol nip. The honeysuckle and banana notes take front stage, along with some toffee apples. Slightly grainy, with more candied fruit. The finish is rather short with a sweet syrupy note.The nose is definitely the best part of this whisky. It's pleasant enough, yet lacking in complexity to be really engaging."

5973,Mackmyra Svensk Ek,"Not my favourite Mackmyra but a decent drinker.Big on vanilla with a hint of fresh hops and quite a bit of oak. Plenty spicy as well, like nutmeg and cracked black pepper corns. Finally some whiffs of pear skin and white grapes.I enjoy the oily mouthfeel, although it is somewhat tannic and has a slight woody bitterness, accompanied by the same spices. There's touches of honey, but it is also quite herbal.Malty and spicy but on the shorter side."

Palate: Very oily on the tongue, taste different than expected. Lots of pepper and vanilla, the wood sugar still leaves a strong sweetness, which is much less fruity than on the nose. Some lime and grapefruit, otherwise a lot of brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon and oak wood. The pepper aroma runs completely through the taste. Finish: Medium-long and dry, the pepper moves into the background and makes room for a mixture of sweet caramel, white coffee and a mild pinch of cinnamon.

This makes the malt very interesting and unique.The juniper smoke is immediately there, unusual but very pleasant and interesting. In addition, sweet apple, vanilla and caramel, fresh citrus notes and culinary herbs. The nose is really fun because of the smoke.Creamy on the tongue and a strong, peppery-spicy start. At first grain and herbal notes predominate, then the smokiness with a clear juniper note prevails more and more.Here, too, the juniper smoke dominates, along with a peppery spiciness. Later salt and again all kinds of culinary herbs. An ashy juniper note then stays on the palate for a really long time."

5996,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,"Non-traditional world whiskies are becoming increasingly popular, and Sweden's Mackmyra is among the pioneers. Interestingly, Svensk Rök uses a combination of local peat and juniper twigs to kiln the barley. Bonfire ashes, dried herbs and a variety of green fruits characterize the nose, which almost reminds me of a young Caol Ila. Dry and pungent in the arrival, the taste develops with aromatic peat smoke, wood sap and fruity sweetness before the long and briny finish kicks in. More ash, smoked ham and spices are following. This malt is certainly worth a try!RATING: 3.7/5.0 stars ≙ 85 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE [+]"
5997,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,"So far, my best Mackmyra. Solid but not outstanding. The combination of peat smoke and barrel maturation works here (in contrast to some other Mackmyra).Dry peat smoke and juniper, plus some BBQ. Malt sweetness and dark fruits and berries.Peat smoke. Sweetness of dark forest honey. Plum. Fresh wood. Pattex. Some pepper.Short. Getting dry. Freshly cut wood, pattex and light fruit notes."
5998,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,"A neat experiment I hope encourages others to try similar. This is a solid dram with enough flavor while also being quite light. While some whiskies lend themselves better to warmer or cooler seasons, I think this one would have a place in any of them.Sweet then smoky. Indiscriminate fruit. Juniper. Herbal.Light. Apple, smoke, spice. A gin-like feel to the flavor.Malty, a bit smoky/ham-like. Medium."

6001,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,
6002,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,"I am always happy when a whisky evokes lively associations in me. This one was like a stroll through the Christmas market (that is, through a cozy little, artisan). For me, Svensk Rök has a wonderful ""flow of aromas"" and a great mouthfeel.Candied apple like at the Christmas market. Clean smoke. At the beginning a little dill and cucumber water, but this note disappears quickly. Green and herbaceous. Earthy notes, freshly cut peat. 2. Nose: waffles with cream. Potato pancakes with applesauce.Vegetable peat note. Subtle tar and also iodine. Rock sugar. Black tea. Grog, or here of course Glögg. Dark chocolate. Candle wax. It also looks a bit nutty and salty.Ginger and anise cookies. Creamy-sweet, I think of eggnog. It exudes beautiful, powerful, tingling, peppery, ethereal warmth. Strong chai tea, sweetened with honey. Smooth, aromatic mouthfeel. Very slightly medical. It also becomes a bit waxy towards the end."
6003,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,"Surprisingly round, despite relatively high ABV and young age. The smoke is not like Islay smoke, more fire and less peat. Otherwise hints of sweetness and Oak. Short conclusion. Lacks some complexity and punch."

6005,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,
6006,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,"Swedish SmokeSvensk Rök, which simply means Swedish smoke, is the only peated single malt available that was produced from only Swedish ingredients. It matured on very small casks of 30 liters. The staves are from American oak, while the heads are in fact from Swedish oak. It is only available in 50cl bottles because the Swedish government (who owns the right to sell alcohol) issued a tender for peaty whisky in small bottles. Mackmyra was awarded the assignment to produce it.The nose is firstly sweet on vanilla and caramel, before the smoke kicks in. The smoke is very discrete, I must say. The fruit translates into apples, oranges, some banana and a surprising touch of juniper berries. Yes, sniffing this with my eyes closed, it reminds me a bit of gin, but with a twist. After a few moments, some sultanas join in.Lightly oily and immediately pretty spicy. Think aniseed, garden herbs and a hint of woodspice. The smokiness develops nicely in a sweet and sour jacket of gooseberries, sniffing tobacco and lime. Surprisingly different from the nose, but pleasant.The finish is rather long, sweet and sour with a salty burst at the very end.I was not very impressed with the nose, but the palate and certainly the finish made up for a lot."
6007,Mackmyra Svensk Rök,"Mackmyra Svensk Rök, 46.1% alc. Original bottling. Expansion: Swedish oak. Type: single malt whisky Nose: The smoke is present immediately, but has a very creamy effect. Moist earth, coniferous forest and vanilla. A little hay and lots of herbs, salty liquorice, honey and even a little chocolate. Palate: Very spicy, lots of earth and various herbs. Here the juniper can also be felt for the first time. In addition, anise, mint and some ammonia. A little Latakia tobacco and sea salt in chocolate. In addition, citrus fruits stay in the background all the time. Finish: Medium to long, spicy. Carry on as you did on the palate, add more mint and a mild pepper aroma.

However, after a while, as the volume went down, the whisky seemed to disintegrate and become very bright and the flavor was dominated by barley spirit (rating between 76-80). I have experienced that with other young spirits as well but with this Mackmyra it happened very quickly. Too bad my bottle was 1 liter.Loads of vanilla and honey sweetness. Malty and rather bright.It's creamy on the palate with sweet vanilla on the side of the tongue, followed by oak and black pepper.With water it disintegrates to a malty vanilla essence part and a barley spirit part (white dog) on the palate. significantly peppery on the finish but still sweet and creamy to start with."

6035,Mackmyra Vit Hund  Svensk New Make,"I have a soft spot for new make and while this one does not make it into my top ten, it certainly was a funny experience. It does not resemble the Mackmyra malts in any way, which again underlines the importance of the casks used for maturation!The nose is almost funny. It certainly brought a smile to my face when I first put my nose in the glass. Candy-like sweetness on barley sugar, very creamy, and at first reminds me of grappa. If you are familiar with the violet cushions of Rocks & Roll Candy? Yup, but in liquid form with a mildly sour twist. Good fun!On the palate it is creamy and sweet like candly as well. Sweeter than anticipated in fact. But nicely spicy too. Think cardamom and eucalyptus. Aspartaam? Yes, tastes like it. And some aspirine even, which is less interesting. Chalk? Weird, all of it. But good fun.There is barely any finish, here."
6036,Mackmyra Vit Hund  Svensk New Make,"Of course, not to compare with a matured whiskey, but rather with a round, complacent Obstler.

6037,Mackmyra Vit Hund  Svensk New Make,"Of course, nothing for the daily dram, but again interesting to taste a new make - that can be very pretty own. Overall, quite mild and not very tasty, not boring or disgusting.sweet, slightly yeasty / pasty, slight alcoholic roaring in the nose, stale canned fruit cocktail water, some spice (caraway, cardamom)first sweet, then spicy (again cumin, cardamom, star anise, possibly cinnamon?)

6048,Maker's Mark Red Wax,"Maker's Mark 45% Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey (I spelt this correctly in my review, but Whiskeybase changed it). 30ml at home, Sep 2021.Dark golden orange. Aroma is faint caramel and wine gums sweets, with an oaky green appley gluey spiritous background, treated oak ... like stained oak. Definitely a little chemically unfortunately but it's not too distracting. Taste delivers some muted caramel and again wine gums (although this vibe is much softer on the palate), a touch of butterscotch and fudge comes up through the watery middle, the finish becomes just slightly salty and the linger is mostly just ethanol (not in a hot way, just in the vaguely minty-salty way that it tastes). Becomes peppery with time, but the pepper never dominates the mint. It's a fairly easy-going whiskey with no rough edges but it doesn't taste quite finished. If you told me this was a salted caramel flavoured vodka I'd believe you. Smells and tastes like it's been aged just for one year, although it must have been in for at least two. Three should be the legal minimum, really. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this but that's the alcohol enjoyer in me talking, rather than the whiskey enthusiast. I would drink this neat happily enough but it's just on the cusp of only being good enough for mixing. For £20 a 70cl wax-topped bottle when on offer, it's not possible to complain too much, but it would never find its way into my whiskey cupboard. 3.2/77"

6053,Mannochmore 12-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"A hidden gem. Really nice mixture of: 1) fresh, apéritif-style aromas (lemon sherbet, orchard fruits, a sprinkling of white pepper and tannic oak to keep things dry); 2) a mineral flintiness that you get from mineral-rich spring waters or certain dry white wines, especially Rieslings, with notes of gravel, limestone, and chalk;3) a shy, but perceptible waft of smoke (less ppm that, say Springbank or Talisker; instead, roughly in the neighborhood of the peatier Dalwhinnies and the new Kilkerrans).And that's the nose alone. On the - initially rather sweet - palate, tropical fruits (especially melons, but also guavas) join the parade, while the smoke gains in strength with each passing second without ever becoming truly prominent. The mineral aspect remains, comfortably co-existing with a fruity juiciness. I find this really artful and nifty. Not a lot of oak throughout, except for some tingling tannins at the death (there was more oak on the nose), but you still get the sense that this was bottled not a moment too early or too late. Twelve years really seems about right here. If I had this blind, I would probably estimate around 15 years of age.Okay, so the finish may be decent but not exactly spectacular. But everything that comes before that is really a pleasant surprise, and I would happily pay 40-45 € for a bottle. This is a light, summer-style apéritif whisky with a mineralic, coal-smoky twist, and that makes it really special in my opinion. Gotta check out more Mannochmore(s), I guess!"
6054,Mannochmore 12-year-old  Flora & Fauna,"Well, that. A malt about the aftertaste, which after a fairly basic taste and aroma breaks well and lasts a long time.Mash, salty herring, lemon, apple jam, vanilla, a wet piece of wood, a drink duchess, a little honey and different spices.Barely sweet, tart tannin, astringent, a little bit bitter.

Behind it comes Ahoi-Brause in the flavor orange.Nutty and less fruity at the beginning than in the nose. Milk coffee, honey, vanilla, fresh wood.

As a single malt drinker I would prefer something less generic but also appreciate a well made malt which this definitely is."

6069,Jameson 18-year-old  Triple Distilled,"Holys**t! I haven’t encountered something so big on flavour but effortless to drink. Rich velvety texture with incredibly well balanced flavours that just roll smoothly from one layer to another. Great for new comers but even better for someone who already likes a Jameson NAS.This is everything I would expect from an older Jameson, with the same amount of sweetness as a Jameson NAS but with more depth and earthy flavours. My personal recommend is also to enjoy this neat because (1) it not just any grocery store whiskey and (2) it’s so effortless to drink you have little excuse not to try it neat. Ultra smooth and completely effortless to drink- a liquid dessert.Link to Review: https://88bamboo.co/blogs/the-bamboo-post/jameson-18-year-old-40-0-obIn the glass, this Jameson is a dark amber colour.On the nose, deep and intense with richness of dark fruits and trailing estery brightness. Initial aromas are full-on rich blend of tropical and dark fruits. There is deep aroma of raisins and hawthorn (山楂). Moderate level of earthiness, woodiness and vanilla flavours, and a scattering of roasted walnut. Despite the earthiness, the freshness and cleanliness of the spirit is remarkable- the intense flavours develop to brighter and fresher notes of pineapple and crisp lemon cream.Absolutely no alcohol burn even when neat!After some 3-4 minutes of airing the whiskey (and I did not add any water because this is already at 40% ABV), the lighter touches of camomile tea come through.On the palate, this is refreshingly sweet with creaminess and viscosity in texture. The opening flavours are rich, sweet but not cloying. Notes of ripe bananas, 7D sugary dried mangoes, developing into dark fruit notes of cherries and hawthorn.Fans of the original NAS Jameson would notice that the original has a much more sugary and lemon-biscuit character. This Jameson 18 on the other hand does have substantial sweetness but carried in darker fruits and more earthy notes, more reminiscent of Lotus biscuits, and a semi-sweet Starbucks coffee latte. You should really try them together for a side-by-side comparison!The flavours then roll towards a moderate European oakiness, with slight coffee / chocolate bitterness, then some roasted walnuts and almonds. Very slight cinnamon and ginger spice.What is really nice about this Jameson is how the flavours gradually flow from one layer to another so smoothly and seamlessly. Everything is well integrated and knows when to show up. No element of flavour seems out of place.The finish is beautifully long, with lingering sweetness from the Lotus biscoff, slight bitterness from the European oak and sliver of ginger."

6071,Jameson 18-year-old  Triple Distilled,"The nose is to kneel, unfortunately on the palate then very disappointing, and with 40% just too watery. Remains due to the fantastic nose a very nice Irishman.Scottish shortbread, but something of strong, that it takes 1-2 minutes, until I also get something. Slowly but then shows ginger and lemon, it goes on with marzipan, vanilla, yellow peach and a hint of cinnamon. Some malt, and Kecksteig. Apfeldatschi. Some oak spice, floral notes and brown sugar.Watery in the mouth, the oak is now much stronger. The butter biscuits are back, some lemon, apples and caramel.Medium.

6078,Jameson Gold Reserve,"Jameson Gold Reserve, 40%. 25ml at home, Sep 2021. Light amber. Aroma is biscuit and bread along with spiky spirit suggesting some menthol. Smells a bit young to me. Slight touch of orange. Mostly biscuity-bready with some char.Taste is soft and easy, very light on the palate but the body is more rounded than you’d expect for something with a flavour this subtle. Light ethereal fruit and bread notes delivered on an velvet soft base. Salty on the swallow and warming on the way down. This was first whiskey of the evening (I wouldn’t tend to drink something at 40% after anything stronger) which definitely helps the warming impression. Faint vanilla lingers. Increasing oak tannin on the finish over time. It’s so light that you can take a big mouthful and it never gets spiky. I wasn’t enchanted by the aroma but the taste is very good in fairness. Doesn’t seem to suffer from the low ABV too much. Extremely drinkable but offers enough interest to qualify as a contemplation whiskey too. Good - it surprised me. 3.5/84"

Finish: medium length, pleasantly warming, light sweetness of caramel, ginger, zest, herbal tea with bitterness. Score: 80 Bottom line: A good representative of the first rung of the Pot Still Whiskey style with minimal kick impact. Unexpectedly pleased with the richness, especially in the finish, this is rarely found in whiskey with minimal strength."
6108,Red Spot 15-year-old  Mitchell & Son,"Actually I planned to try the Red Spot 15 in a parallel tasting with the also 46% Redbreast 15. Now it has become a solo tasting, the comparison comes later. Just so much, from memory: The Redbreast 15 is a completely different caliber and due to the fact that the Red Spot 15 matured in a Marsala barrel, among others, a comparison probably does not make much sense. Will ultimately be a matter of taste.  The Marsala cask clearly makes its contribution, and just ahead: too much. In the ""Spot Series"" he agrees well with the Green Spot and the Yellow Spot, the spots have always been a bit different.A fat sweetness that flows towards you from the glass. But the Marsala barrel has done a great job. Dried figs and sweet raisins. At the beginning, only a little spicy, the sweetness initially overlaps all the other flavors. If he gets a bit of ""rest"", spices slowly come out of the background and have leather and tobacco notes in tow. Cinnamon, marjoram, cloves, nutmeg and pepper, tasty mixture, which now makes you want more. Now he looks more like a classic single pot still, which one could doubt something at the beginning.Mild and very creamy onset - and while you still think what that is for a boring comrade, he shoots spices without end, with pepper forms a major component. Milk chocolate, toffee and vanilla. Cherries, raisins and fruit candy flavor. Mentholig and drifts at times towards children Em-Eukal, but the spices take something of the sweetness.Medium long and dry with time. Cherry flavor and menthol, wood. Menthol thinner in the finish than he could probably be at the age of 15."
6109,Red Spot 15-year-old  Mitchell & Son,"A classic example of first-class Irish whiskey, wonderfully fruity but also strong and complex.Wonderfully fresh and fruity classic Irish whiskey, red fruits, grapes.Flattering and pleasantly round, again fruity, apples, strawberries, raspberries, nicely spicy with cloves and allspice.Nice long aftertaste, multi-dimensional and quite complex, very warming."

In low-degree situations, it is indeed much better than most Solvay without peat and Shirley.Full of rich and stimulating tropical fruit flavor, plantain, selling jackfruit and mango can also help you pack fruit stand, roasted banana, 502, table tennis racket just finished with raw rubber, alcohol is not very docile.  Then there is the smell of nuts, five flavors of Qia Qia Xiang Sunflower Seeds, a lot of interesting butter cookies, gold and silver buns.  Finally, some subtle floral fragrances were slowly separated from it, vines, leaves, etc., but were suddenly covered with rich fruits and oil.Kumquat honey water made without sugar in advance, plum cake, cooked pear paste, very little salt, slightly bitter, soybean powder, deep grains and cores, cocoa beans, slightly spiced powder.Medium, similar to the finish of drinking butter tea, slightly bitter, slightly salty, walnut powder."
6117,Red Spot 15-year-old  Mitchell & Son,"Compared to the Redbreast 15yo more charged by the Marsala and in a way also more pleasing. But less spice, oak and somehow also depth.  It's pretty good. I like the redbreast better."
6118,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"Like the previous batch, it needs something in the nose to get going. You can speed up this procedure by adding a few drops of water, but it doesn't have to be, giving time is also sufficient. And when the necessary time has passed, it really turns up, so that you can once again congratulate yourself on buying this bottling.At first a little closed, after a while a basket full of tropical fruits appears: passion fruit, papaya, mango, dragonfruit, banana. But also dried figs and raisins, which together with a nougat chocolate note form the foundation. Increasing seasoning, whereby the individual components cannot be separated from one another: simply a spice rack.Dry and not too violent start, the 56.3% glide comfortably over the tongue. Creamy, fat and full, also here with a good portion of tropical fruits. Nougat, almond chocolate, toffee, caramel. The pot still spices, which initially treat the palate with a good portion of pepper, and then a little later with allspice, marjoram, tarragon, thyme and cumin, are quite early on the pot still spices. The tropical fruits from the beginning had taken a little break in between, but are now branding again. I like that very much when flavors that have already been ticked off and passed by come back again.Medium to long finish, actually. You don't really trust a 12yo, but it happens quite often, especially with Redbreast. I blame it on the pot still spices, thanks for the large amount of unmalted barley. Grated nutmeg, fresh ginger, clove powder, thyme. With nougat, almonds and rapeseed honey."
6119,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"Quick hit review.It's hard to find an Irish whiskey with a craft presentation, so this is as good as it gets. On the nose, whiffs of lime juice, peach and sawdust mix with wood spices, grass and black pepper. Fruity-sweet and floral, the taste convinces with gingerbread, green apples and balanced oak notes. The cask strength ensures a long and satisfying finish. You can't go wrong with this Redbreast!RATING: 4.0/5.0 stars ≙ 87 pts → FIRST-CLASS"
6120,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"I've had the ""normal"" 12YO and found it to be an OK slightly above average Irish. Getting it at cask strength raised it to another level. The lighter profile of Irish needs this extra punch to be interesting, and if it gets too hot you always got the option to water it down yourself.Sweet and fruity, zesty yellow orange, yet not as tropical as I find most Irish.Vanilla oak with a spicy edge.Vegetal, greenery, thistle.Water removes a lot of the alc feel and opens up more nuances nicely.Creamy texture.Sweet and spicy arrival. Pleasantly hot.Apple juiceWater makes it naturally less hot, but it still packs a lot of spice.Long and quite spicy. Fades slow and steady.Dramtically shortened by water."

6123,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"I've had the normal Redbreast a very long time ago and quite liked it, this is a different animal and also quite liked this one. Thanks to Peatbogger for the sample.I am getting something artificial and it's strange because it's the first thing that hits you and I have trouble getting past it, maybe if I leave it a while. That's a bit more like it, the sherry cask is showing it's hand. Red berries and strong coffee.There is something bourbonesque about it.This is like a hot cross bun straight out of the oven on a hot plate on a hot day. Nice and chewy and if I was tasting this blind I wouldn't have said it was Irish. This is perfectly palatable at cask strength and so it shall remain. Sherry notes and spice coat the mouth.From the first initial blast the finish is long and more calming. There is a creamy texture left right at the death."
6124,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"A great 12 year old Redbreast at cask strength. This version is quite tropical and nutty.Concerning price/performance ratio: 9/10Some glue, pineapple, sweet honey with pine, vanilla, fruits (mango and other tropical fruits getting more present with some water).Pineapple, apples, again some glue, citrus, spicy, red pepper, sweet wood sticks. With water a bunch of fruits.Medium to long. Some exotic fruits, a bunch of nuts, hints of cloves. With water a bunch of fruits more. Spicy oak."
6125,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"I have to admit, I love the Redbreast 21. This batch of the 12CS clearly has the same DNA. A little less tropical fruit like mango, papaya and honeymelon but more punch. I will have to blend both to see the result. This little experiment should be really interesting. A steal for under 60£/€/$. E150 colorant sucks though.some drops of water help a lotwatered it down to my sweet spot just around 50%,amazing quality.can't quite keep up with the nose and taste. Medium length."

6127,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"Like the current 15yo, the current batch of the 12 CS shows surprisingly tropical fruits - where there were never any before. I refilled twice, I couldn't believe it. And yet .... Like the 15yo, this is also very good for the 12 CS! A little 21yo feeling in barrel strength, why not?At first glance it looks ""lighter"" and fruity than its predecessors ... Yes, indeed. There are raisins and other dried fruits, but there is also fresh peach, lemon, grapefruit. The fresh fruits have never been found in a 12 CS. Mild spice and herb mix with white pepper, clove powder, some anise, lavender.Clearly chocolate and toffee at the beginning. Strong start with perfectly integrated alcohol. On the tongue, too, the impression prevails that it is dealing with fresh (tropical) fruits. A little leather and raisins, yes, but first violin play melon, peach, apricot, lemon. It looks lighter and airier (not thinner!) Than the previous batches. Caramel candy and still toffee. Increasingly spicy with nutmeg, clove powder, juniper berries, cardamom.You have something from him for a long time. If it does not become too dry, the tropical fruits have a good effect and after-effects, but in the end, a good portion of seasoning hits the tongue."
6128,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"For me, this Redbreast 12CS is one of the very best younger whisk (e) ys currently available on the market. Batch B2 / 19 seems even more intense and fruity to me than batch B1 / 19 (ID: 131922). A more than successful thing, also because you actually get two whiskeys in one due to the barrel strength, you are ready to play with some water and feel the changes in flavor.The bakery is there immediately, the honey and mango; in addition the herbal flavor and the fresh whiskey crunch of a cask strong. Very strong in every way. After a long time in the glass there are still pear and apricot aromas, ripe peach, a little sweetness of lychee juice. Chervil and some fennel. Black bread without rind.Comes into the mouth very strong, fruity and full of bread aromas. Apricot and peach are in the foreground, the herbs with fennel and a little marjoram appear, the spice-fruit combination is very nice. The 55.8% evoke a slight tingling sensation, the wood slowly becomes stronger. The spicy, spicy notes remain perfectly integrated into the dense fruitiness and bread aroma.The finish is not quite as long as one would dream of from the smell and the initial taste. That's what the older Redbreast variants are for. Of course, the finish remains intense and medium-long, never becomes too bitter, the fruitiness fades slowly, the herbal notes ensure a lasting memory. _A little water_ makes the apricot and mango aromas even stronger, as does the slight hint of eucalyptus, and the fennel is accompanied by a little rosemary. The fruits also become a little more intense on the palate, at the same time the ""crunchiness"" increases, the herbs take a back seat, the bread notes become stronger. A very exciting variant!"
6129,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"At the beginning there is a strong attack of ginger, which over time turns into peppery fresh pears Diluted to what feels like 43% significantly more apples and pears, fresher, greenerFresh white pepper, hot start. Then yellow boiled fruit with a hint of the cores to go with it Add a touch of almond kernels with waterLong and spicy, digestible with water and soft, mild, medium-long with a fine hint of spice"

6131,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"WoodspicesDarn, the last time I tried this 12 years old Redbreast at cask strength was way back in 2012. But I recently got a sample from the Irish whiskey aficionado Benny, so I had no excuse to postpone this tasting session any longer. I have no reason to complain. It is a pot still whiskey, meaning that both malted and unmalted barley were used. It is vatting of both bourbon and sherry casks. Lovely nose on tropical fruit with banana, pineapple and passionfruit in the lead, followed by a soft spiciness and some floral notes. I also get some pencil shavings and toasted oak. For a moment there it reminds me of a good grain whiskey, strangely enough. Perfect mouthfeel. The tropical fruit returns, but is now partly overcome by lots of black pepper and vanilla. The alcohol let's itself be felt. All kinds of wood spices go hand in hand with candies pineapple, mashed banana and a truckload of caramel. Very long finish on some oak, that pushes the fruit somewhat to the background. The woodspices linger very long. This is very good stuff. Around 80 EUR. It is worth every penny. Having said that I did prefer the version from 2012."
6132,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"I always liked the 12 year old, one of my faves at the local pub to be honest. But this beats it by a landslide. The texture is great and everything is really well integrated. One of my favorite Irish Whiskeys ever.The nose starts very fruity. Tropical fruits like pineapples, and passion fruit dominate at first also lemons and a little bit of pepper and a bit of grass.Oh wow. This is terrific. The tropical fruits are still very dominant but they are joined by pepperish taste, alcohol and vanilla.The finish is long and very tasty. You can clearly taste the oak and vanilla and the tropical fruits go to the back. Also lovely sherry taste. Dark berries and dark chocolate and cocoa."
6133,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"The new illustrations of the entire Redbreast range reissue in 2019 are by Irish illustrator Denise Nestor. They show the eponymous robin frozen in different stages of movement.

6134,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"Very nicely done. It took me a little more time than the 15-year-old drinking strength to grasp it. A dream of a post-still whiskey with a lot of depth and a strong and full aroma (spicy-wine-tart pâtisserie, if there is something like that). I bake Americans and enjoy a nice oloroso with it.Dark and malty. I initially perceive the alcohol strength in the direction of ""ink"". Then over time it unfolds. Strongly sweetened espresso and lots of caramel. Also something like honey-sweetened fennel tea. Warming spiciness: cardamom, allspice (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves). Rye bread I also have a lot of vanilla and an American with cocoa glaze. The very dense and full nose also has plenty of juicy dried fruits and walnuts to offer. Otherwise, not so much in the foreground for me, cooked fruits, maybe something like peach, apricot, orange jam.Very substantial. Spicy rye bread, but also sweet and doughy. Nice espresso bitter and roasted notes. Dark chocolate.Tart wine aromas. I also have grapes here. Furthermore, a very oily, creamy, full-flavored texture. At the back then slightly polished oak with the warm spices that have already appeared in the nose. It warms and pizzas wonderfully and leaves a lasting, creamy, dry, aromatic feeling in the entire mouth. My tooth is dripping!"

It opens up nicely after some times on fragrant cereals and flowers (strangely reminding me the good side of cheap bourbons) and lots of mixed fresh fruits. It smells yummy but nothing sweet. A kind of sugar-free pastry.M : Well I can't believe this is 55,8%. Blind I would've guess around 46 ? Because it's really soft, it lacks a bit of body but there's a little spicy tingling that goes with higher abv. Anyway, very gentle just like the nose and definitely not mind blowing. A touch of white pepper to enhance the profile and that's it.F : A rather short fruity muesly, lightly lingering on dry herbs or hay and a slight chili slapback.I'm left really disappointed with this. It's ok, but it feels like another mid-range bottle and not something you'd pay nearly 100€ for. I have nice coffee notes from the empty glass which make me hope it gets better and richer with time. 5/10Spoiler alert a few months later : still very shy."
6137,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength Edition,"Admittedly, I like Redbreast. But with the greatest possible objectivity: that's a damn good whiskey. With 54.6% as low speed as never before. But that, I have the impression, is very good for the whiskey. You get an aroma load in the nose and on the tongue, the hammer.Ah, that nose ...  Tired of pot still spices, you don't even know where to start and then stop much later. Bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, nutmeg, pepper, a little lovage - to name just a few spices. Licorice notes. Raisins, dried figs. Cocoa powder, ground coffee beans. A trace of solvent.Creamy, viscous, spicy, sherry fruity - alcohol perfectly integrated. He also lets off steam with pot still spices on the tongue. A competition with the raisins and dried figs for the predominance of flavors. Whereby: For a competition, both parties actually harmonize much too well with each other. Caramel, honey, vanilla, marzipan bread. Cinnamon and coriander.Long finish, still creamy. The pot still spices are still not calm, raisins and dried figs also tumble through the area. It's amazing how long a 12 year old can hold. Chocolate, caramel, honey. Liquorice."

Nutmeg, thyme, rosemary and lovage. This is accompanied by sultanas, cherries, hops and ovaltines. In the background there are hints of toasted aromas and sandalwood.Creamy, voluminous and spicy start. Dark fruits spread in the mouth, sultanas and figs, accompanied by hops, fudge, sweet forest honey and dried herbs. Rosemary, chervil, pepper and a light note of cinnamon follow.Still creamy and flavorful. The sultanas and figs are still there and are accompanied by aromas of coffee and toasted. Blood oranges and crème brulée waft in the background, which harmonize wonderfully with the oak notes."
6139,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength Edition,"My first redbreast and it not only did not disappoint my expectations, but almost over-fulfilled them. A strong 92-point spirit for me. I like the fruity ones with a good flavor and absolute creaminess. This 12-year-old redbreast with a strong barrel delivers this perfectly. He also drinks undiluted so pleasantly that it is a pure danger.  _With a little water_ it becomes (caramel) sweeter on the one hand and on the other hand mango and avocado appear even more. On the palate, the oak wort becomes a bit more intense; the oiliness remains. A very nice variant. I like this strong redbreast diluted and undiluted equally good.A dense mixture of sherry, some ""grainy"" (sorry, I'm not an Irish expert!), Malt and pear. Some bread (black bread without rind). The longer in the glass, the more pear and avocado appear in the nose. Very exciting.Again very dense and oily, sherry, at the beginning a light note of bread, then pear fruit and again the delicate ""grainy"", which may well be known as ""typical pot still seasoning"". Pleasant, never too dominant oak aromas. Pear and avocado; very fine fruit aromas. The 54.6% are optimally integrated in the oily overall arrangement.The finish is medium to long, warm and persistent. The sherry and fruit notes are not killed by the oak, but pleasantly complemented. Very good, very pleasant."

6142,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength Edition,"Aroma: rather delicate, well-known sherry component, raisins, dried forest berries, currant jam, then bread tones, flour, cereal, varnished tree, dry wood, vanilla, pleasant fresh muffin, glaze, cotton candy. Everything seems to be simple, but the aromas wander, shimmer, outgrow one another, class! Organically simple, but interesting, malt replaces wine, it is replaced by wood and aggressive varnish and everything in a circle ... it’s not boring to enjoy it.  Taste: repetition, delicately, slightly perfumed, powder, a lot of dark berry jam, moderate sweetness, diluted with delicate oak, tannins, peel and seeds of berries, again more abundant varnish as in good bourbon, spicy spices.  Finish: longer than average, berry jam, currant in all its manifestations (jam, fresh leaves, tea from its leaf), a nice dry tree, and again something liqueur-jam.  Rating: 89  Bottom line: great whiskey, as long as it's the best Irish whiskey I've tried. I can’t even name the shortcomings, I have not tried other batches, but everything is very good here!

6146,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength Edition,"Very comparable in quality to the 2016 version, so same score. I always feel that the more abundantly sherried style that the CS displays is not necessarily to its benefit. The oak is a bit too modern (i.e., too obviously seasoned) and ""loud"" for my taste.Sherry-seasoned, pretty active American oak, morello cherries, marzipan, barley, and lots of spices (cinnamon, cumin, nutmeg...). The massive sherry influence tends to drown out the brighter, lighter fruits and boost the darker, spicier aspects.Really cool mouthfeel. Again lots of cherry-flavored herbal cough drops and marzipan sweetness. Wheat beer. Nicely spicy with this quintessential Irish pot still impression that always strikes me as somewhat ""dusty"" and cereal-based – perhaps like muesli grains ground down to tiny particles. Definitely packs more of a punch than the more subtle and complex 15-year-old, which I prefer by a substantial margin.Honey, coriander, cloves, cherries. Medium long."
6147,Redbreast 12-year-old  Single Pot Still,"This is a great bottle at its price range – it is a rather straightforward flavour profile of vanilla and sherry sweetness that may be said to be tried and tested to be widely popular with all folks. It is also very flavourful considering its 40.0% ABV.Anyone who enjoys Christmas cake with dried fruits, or toasted raisin buns would enjoy this, and a simple man like me certainly does. At its price range, I would recommend any alcoholic to include the Redbreast 12 in his personal collection as a go-to drink, and if not, as something for his friends who are just beginning to drink whiskey (or whiskey).Link to review: https://88bamboo.co/blogs/the-bamboo-post/redbreast-12-years-old-new-midleton-distillery-40-0-obIn the glass, the whiskey is a deep amber indicative of a long sherry maturation.On the nose, the whiskey leads with moderate vanilla with lightly toasted almonds and walnuts. This develops into a clean sweet fragrance of Sherried fruits, such as raisins and cranberries. There is a slight floral fragrance and fresh cut grass.On my tasting, a surprisingly sweet first act, with vanilla, cereal and honey-roasted almonds, with growing notes of caramelized apple. The sweet malty notes are very very clean and crisp, indeed true to its Irish triple-distilled character.In the midst of it, some sherry and spice grow on my palate, although it felt rather subtle because my attention was focused on the sweet and light malt. Once I caught notes of some dark fruits, I do realise the “sherry undertones” advertised on the label are indeed present and further sips draw me closer. There is a flavourful but well-rounded sherry note with raisins, cranberries, hawthorn candy flakes (山楂) and a bit of woodiness from the toasted barrel. Very very slight leatheriness and spice accompany the dry fruits. The texture is velvety and lovely, and I really like the marriage of equals between the clean and sweet vanilla flavours on one hand and sherry notes and spice on the other. Neither profile overwhelms the other, which leaves me to be able to enjoy both.The finish is long, with raisins and hawthorn candy, and warming ginger spice. While the flavours are light and crisp, the texture is not just smooth but somewhat creamier and more velvety than Scottish single malt- perhaps I am thinking too much but I would attribute this difference to the unmalted barley used for Irish."
6148,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"Spoiled by B2 / 19, I missed its tropical fruits for a brief moment ... a little water helped. The 57.6% of the current batch is already clearly noticeable, a few drops of water brings it close to the previous batch with its 55.8%. These delicious tropical fruits can be found again, and the spices also appear a little more tamed and even better integrated. I really don't want to miss the 12 CS ...Right at the start with a full load of pot still spices: savory, thyme, rosemary, tarragon, cloves, aniseed, nutmeg and pepper. While its predecessor, Batch B2 / 19, still came up with a basket full of tropical fruits, B1 / 20 delivers more dark fruity notes of blackcurrants and blueberries. But it also weighs 57.6%, while Batch B2 / 19 was only 55.8%. Let's see what a few drops of water can do ... And yes, just add a little water (a few drops to 2cl) reveal the tropical fruits that were so surprisingly found in its predecessor. Maracuja and mango are vying for pole position, and something banana wants to get involved. It now comes across as much thicker, provides dark chocolate, warm coffee grounds, toffee, caramel, malt and sugar beet syrup. The spices as a constant companion. Dry wood, leather, raisins.Powerful start, oily, creamy, fat. Since it has been diluted with a few drops of water beforehand, the tropical fruits (passion fruit, mango, papaya) appear on the tongue and combine nicely with the chocolate notes that are also immediately present. The pot still spices (tarragon, thyme, bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon and cardamom) do not impose themselves, but are nevertheless very easy to spot. Raisins and dates cheat among the tropical fruits, dry wood plays a role. Coffee beans, liquorice snails.We'll come to the end, please, and give up ... Apparently does not apply to him. Lingers on the tongue for quite a long time, as his (only) 12 years in the barrel are hardly noticeable; he works much further and more mature. Dry wood, powdered cloves, grated nutmeg and pepper, raisins and an echo of tropical fruits. Caramel candy, forest floor."
6149,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"Archer definitely has a special relationship with Redbreast, and I generally agree with what he said. Without water it is quite hot (also on the nose, but mostly on the palate) and really blackcurrants and blueberries are among the main fruits. About half a teaspoon makes it significantly softer and reveals a tropical taste profile dominated by ripe mango and passion fruit. A whole teaspoon reveals a third parallel reality, which is dominated by fruits such as apricot and fig, and at the same time makes it a little hotter again. I guess adding even more water would take it to some fourth place, so you could extract a wide range of fruit from it or eventually adjust it to your taste preferences. I personally share Archer's passion for exotic fruits. Sometimes it's a little difficult to hit the right dose, but over time you get used to doing it right. Undoubtedly the Irish whiskey with the best value for money. It costs 40 euros here."
6150,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"First fresh and dry on the nose, then herbs, thyme, rosemary, juniper, fresh spinach, black pepper, mushrooms, dried plums and dates, fresh leather, coffee beans, in the distance a little honey Water opens the whiskey a little more, it becomes finer and a few notes are added.Slightly sharp start, a few drops of water help here too. Spicy, then sweet, dried fruits (figs and plums), candied papaya, vanilla, forest honey, hops, again juniper, rosemary and thyme, pumpernickel, dried datesVery briefly something medicinal with a bitter wood note, then a long spicy finish that leaves a pleasant sweetness at the end, plus a little orange zest with a hint of honey. Without water, I find the finish a bit rounder and less medicinal / bitter, which is at the expense of the nose and palate. Depending on the dilution, I would give the finish between 88 and 90 points."
6151,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,
6152,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"At the beginning of our tasting, we uncorked this massive Redbreast and compared it to a Waterford (Ballymorgan 1.1), which is just allowed to call itself whiskey. There are worlds between the two, especially if you include the price-performance ratio in the evaluation. Against the strong, extremely complex, highly aromatic and fruity robin, even if we use water to 50% vol. dilute, the 3-year-old looks like Newmake bottled directly after the distillation, almost only alcoholic. Granted, not a fair comparison, but it does open your eyes. (On other days and without direct comparison, I also find fruity aromas in the youngster, but as I said: Only the strong robin creates and creates a flight of fancy.) I will probably stay with Redbreast CS for the next 10 years!"
6153,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"For taste, please refer to 12yo, they are almost the same. This CS version does allow people to enjoy a richer, more explosive scent of atomic bombing, However, in terms of taste, it caused some irritation and interference due to the alcohol concentration as high as 57%. A slight deduction is made for the original intention of ""comfortable drinking"", because the taste of the 40% version is very smooth and harmonious. The general whiskey will be adjusted at 40%-46%. It is also for this reason that the ""non-stimulating taste"" and ""the strong aroma of the original wine"" are hung on the two ends of the scale to achieve the best balance and meet the taste of the public. For this bottle of wine, I personally think that it is the most balanced when the alcohol concentration is adjusted to about 50%. There is enough taste and enjoyment at the end, but it is not disturbed by the irritating in the mouth, which is really good. If I have this bottle at home, I can adjust the alcohol concentration I want to drink tonight according to my daily mood, and enjoy different experiences of the same whiskey at different alcohol concentrations. It's just that in the Taiwan market, this wine is really too expensive, and the stock is very small. I only hope that they can be imported into Taiwan more in the future. The taste sums up to 90 points and the price does not affect the rating. I'm also sure I'll be a Redbreast lover for life."
6154,Redbreast 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"Inspired by some reviews by Archer here on Whiskeybase, I regained my interest in Irish whiskey and Redbreast in specific. What a shame that in the last century Irish whiskey industry became an ""endangered species"". Because the knowledge, history, environment are there. I hope the Irish distilleries will really rise again.Initially a little closed, but patience and hand-warming improve things by the minute. After 30 minutes you are confronted with an outburst of tropical fruit. In the background some herbs, light spices and dried fruits. Elegant and all well integrated.Warm and powerful arrival and a tad sharp; but not annoying or disturbing. Spices take the floor immediately and push the sweet and fruity notes more to the back. Slightly wry but again not disturbing. Some drops of water make things somewhat more friendly.Warm long finish. Peppery flavors are dominant in the finish. In the far end dry, grassy and fresh. Conclusion: powerful dram of a distillery which never disappointed me (although the Redbreast 12y OB at 40% is the weakest of course)."

I was guessing something in the style of Auchentoshan. I definitely put her in eighth, last place, otherwise she finished seventh overall (69 judges). Slightly musty and yellow fruit in the aroma. After adding water artificiality and nail polish. The taste is very strong, rather unpleasant, artificial, biting and acetone. After adding water a little à la Auchentoshan. Roks log, artificial taste. Extremely drying in the finish and after the addition of water, a distinctive lemon peel."
6158,Redbreast 12-year-old,"Already countless times - different vintages - in the glass, and yet again and again surprising what he is able to achieve with his 40% vol. When freshly poured, he is sometimes a little shy; you should allow him to rest in the glass for a few minutes. Because then he opens the full single pot still program, shows great spice and sherry notes. A classic you can't get dead.If you give the whiskey a rest in the glass for a little while, it will reward you with rich, but not intrusive sherry notes, which are in the form of raisins, dried figs, ripe grapes and blackberries. At the beginning only slightly spicy, the spices intensify as nosing progresses, nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon and coriander appear. Marzipan bread and nougat, chocolate flakes.Silky, soft and creamy, with a well-balanced spice note right from the start, which also covers and accompanies the dried fruit that is also present from the start. Long-stored, well-dried old wooden floorboards, old leather, dry tobacco leaves. Mild liquorice, ginger. Sugar beet syrup, pumpernickel.Medium to long, dry. Long-lasting, not too intrusive sherry notes. Together with the spices as well as the tobacco and leather notes, this results in a very tasty, long finish."

6160,Redbreast 12-year-old,"[2021.12.30] Very fragrant smell as soon as I opened the bottle, very good first impression! After tasting it, I was even more amazed at his balance and supple taste. The overall performance makes it hard to believe that this is just a 40% abv whiskey, what an outstanding performance! Too bad the cask strength version doesn't seem to be available in my area, I think that would be more perfect...! The whole bottle of whiskey gives me the feeling of ""elegance"", The first smell is delicate and lovely like Robin redbreast, but after drinking it, it also has a strong and beautiful inner. Good standard presentation, recommend buying a full bottle. The sum of the taste is 86 points and the price does not affect the rating. [2022.1.3] Oh my.... I have to revise my rating because this Redbreast keeps getting better and better in the days after opening, the complex aroma and oily body continue to grow, and tonight I'm really sure, It's damn excellent! I have to buy a few more bottles and keep an open bottle in the cupboard at all times. With just 40% ABV and 12 years old, it disintegrated my knowledge of whiskey, and now I know that a good whiskey can still make a door to heaven within these constraints. I must continue to try 12yo Cask Strength & 15yo, and I hope the wine merchants in Taiwan can help import some. This is my humble request. [2022.1.6] Finally can be compared with 15yo. Personally, I prefer 12yo's expression, Although there are shortcomings of lack of power, but the overall is very round, Very comfortable to drink, I'm sure I need to stock up. The total taste is 88 points, the price does not affect the score, and it is definitely worth the money.Very round smell, quite nice, I have rarely experienced such a warm and mellow scent. Mainly sweet butterscotch, Brie cheese, vanilla, caramel, freshly baked bread, etc., sweet and mild taste, Even some honey, flower and fruit aroma. It's so comfortable that I can smell it all night long.It is obviously only a 12-year-old young whiskey, but it does not irritate the mouth at all. The sweet aroma diffuses in the mouth, and the wine adheres harmoniously to the tongue, gradually feeling the warmth. But compared to the standard whiskey I drink in the past, the taste seems to be a bit bland (perhaps it has something to do with Irish triple distillation?)A well-balanced aroma remains on the throat. Too bad the finish isn't very long. But this just makes people want to drink another dram quickly! Oh, this bottle of mine should be empty soon."
6161,Redbreast 12-year-old,"The aroma is dominated by a nut platter along with baked apples with honey. On the palate there are waxed dried apricots and fatty southern raisins, nut butter and butter. The finish is simple, short, creamy chocolate, buttery. A very simple, but impeccably balanced whiskey, the standard version of this two is probably a little more pleasant, but this is also very good. RATING: 84pts - | 83 - 86 (B) → Good | - Not a “must”, but a nice-to-have."
6162,Redbreast 12-year-old,"Nose: Spiced fruit, mainly apples and pears. Some hints of vanilla. Beautifully oaky.Palate: More spiced fruit, the palate has some citrus. Malty. Sherry coming through nicely. Charred oak. Finish: Long. Warm and smooth. Vanilla lingering.Overall Score: 89. This is a fantastic whiskey. The buzz around this one is not overhyped or exaggerated. The whiskey is beautifully light and sweet. It has a very mature flavor to it and does not disappoint in terms of complexity. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. I’m excited to get the 15."
6163,Redbreast 12-year-old,"This bottle is from just before the rebranding. Bottlecode: L917731394 21:26This is an perfect daily dram!Sweet and delicate notes of wood, honey, spice and some ripe blackberries. There is a little mettalic note in the background, but nothing to worry.Sweet and tasty. Quite full bodied for a 40%ABV! There is marzipan, wood, red berries, hint of oak again, some sawdust and caramel.Medium length. There is a burst of vanilla and caramel. It gives a lovely creamy flavour. Besides that there is a hint of oak and some ice-cream."
6164,Redbreast 12-year-old,"https://whiskeylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2020/05/16/an-irish-an-islay-and-an-indie/N: Is this sherry, or maybe madeira cask-matured whiskey? It’s odd enough [and estery enough] for Glen Scotia for sure, but there’s something very distinctive about this I feel I should be grasping sooner. Descriptors speak of waxy-to-puttied sweet fruits with a chemical/industrial edge. Becomes more and more pleasant as it opens up, the fruits becoming more tropical [the penny should have dropped by then].T: This is an odd waxy fruity [old?] thing. With a little fizz it becomes more creamy and again, industrial/metallic/putty,… is this a Lidl’s job? It’s Irish, has to be Irish!? More complex fruit sugars emerge over time. Pleasing to see there’s no offensive finishing, as it doesn’t need any. Definitely has some firm age to it.F: Becomes definitively sour with dairy/butyric wax capacitors and subtle oak=malt sugars. The soft vanilla is deep and low key.C: It’s good this, though subjectively, it may depend on what your take on the butyric waxiness is. A snipper’s guess, I shoot for Lidl’s 26yo Irish [WLP187/WLP286]. Revealed! Affordable and commendable, I’m amazed it’s ‘only’ 12yo. Last time I had this was in 2017 when I told myself to buy a bottle. Today, the same score and sentiment."
6165,Redbreast 12-year-old,"Room temperature when drinking: 17 ℃  Watching Eyes: Honey  Smell Nose: At first, it was green apple caramel, grass (no grassy smell), dewdrops, wildflowers, roses and other relatively fresh elements. Slowly sweet milk began to escape, honey, caramelized apples, cinnamon bread, Wangzi milk . It feels that the Bourbon barrel is relatively large.  Taste Palate: wheat, heavy cheesecake, half-cooked cheese, egg milk, fig milk, green apple candy, a little oak  Finish: Finish, long, astringent, dry, hard candy, red apple, fragrant pear  Body: Medium, with a bitter bottom, oily texture, the liquor is tightly clumped from beginning to end in the mouth, I like it very much  Nose: 85/100  Palate: 85/100  Finish: 84/100  Body: 85/100  Overall: 84/100  Overall: The smell is relatively pure, and it is a simple fruit dessert."
6166,Redbreast 12-year-old,"Pours a medium colored gold. Scent is full, funky, heavy grains. Not overly integrated, if i'm perfectly honest. Old wood, not very specifically sherry nor bourbon. Taste is fairly sweet, Taste at least is much more integrated. Noticably buttery, grainy base. Recognizable bourbon, not much on the sherry. Not sure I love this ... Buttered bread character is just a tad too high. Alcohol remains smooth, not as good (not even close) as the lustau edition."
6167,Redbreast 12-year-old,
6168,Redbreast 15-year-old,"Probably the most versatile bottling in the Redbreast range. I already had batches in which the adhesive note was so intense that you could have typed blindly and ""without guilty hesitation"" on a bourbon. Then again there were bottlings, with the emphasis on dark and overripe berry notes.  This one is a chameleon, offers a little bit of everything, even a hint of tropical fruits, which you can only find in colleagues who have matured for 21 years and longer. Highly recommended!A mix of fresh blackberries and blueberries on the one hand and dried plums on the other, overripe grapes and raisins. A wonderful spice note that at first cannot be broken apart. Initially furniture polish or an adhesive note that may be reminiscent of bourbon. But that goes away. Tobacco, leather, almonds, dark chocolate, milk coffee. Now clove powder, bay leaves, nutmeg. Hazelnut crumbs.Creamy and viscous, with sweet blackberry jam, wild berries, black cherries, plums. Fruit-stressed - and you can already guess the tropical fruits as they will appear on the 21yo! This was not the case with previous editions of the 15yo. Mild spice - and slowly a little melon actually creeps forward. Dry wood, malt, sugar beet syrup, caramel.Medium to long, chocolatey, (almost fresh) fruity. Coffee beans and caramel pudding, cinnamon & coriander, marzipan."

6170,Redbreast 15-year-old,"After several inconclusive tastings spread over 6 months I decided to give it one last chance to brighten up this sad forced confinement ...  Well, I have to say that the more I drink it, the more I wonder where the heck went the know-how and quality that characterized the old version. The Redbreasts are on the downward slope and this is a big mess.  No complexity, even the 46 degrees can not hide the shortcomings of this product which is very (too) marked by bourbon and which leaves no space for the fruitiness typical of Redbreast of yesteryear.  Only point that saves appearances: alcohol is well integrated.Vanilla, new invasive wood, macro currant (looking carefully ...)Thin body, Vanilla, caramel, hazelnuts, a light dash of red fruitsLong, buttered new wood, toffee and a discreet hint of orange (juice)"
6171,Redbreast 15-year-old,"Certainly not a bad redbreast. However, if I want more elegance and depth, I prefer the 21er. If I want more strength, then the 12er CS is my choice. So the 15 is not as interesting for me as the other two colleagues."
6172,Redbreast 15-year-old,"I thought this would be an upgraded version of 12yo, but it's actually another way of saying it. It adds some berry tartness and spice spiciness, and boosts the alcohol for a fuller, fuller flavor, and it's all about invigorating. 12yo and 15yo happen to be as expressed by their respective patterns, 12yo is a very cute and mellow Redbreast standing quietly. 15yo is a Redbreast full of strength and self-confidence who is flying with strong wings. In fact, the performance of this bottle is very outstanding, and it is definitely an excellent whiskey. The stronger scent and the longer finish give him a more distinct personality, a great piece. The taste score is 90 points, and the price does not affect the score.The experience here is over 12yo and it's very nice. Start with sweet and sour berries, Brie cheese, freshly baked bread, vanilla, oak, and some spicy pepper, honey. The way of expression is obviously different from that of 12yo, and the stimulation of alcohol is slightly highlighted, but this does not affect its beauty.The 46% ABV allows it to express more intense aromas of cheese, honey and barley, and a touch of spiciness in the complex aroma, perhaps this is the characteristic of pot still. The smell of oak is almost gone, replaced by sweet vanilla, caramel, etc. The overall taste is very strong, but it also brings some alcohol stimulation and pepper-like spiciness. It is not as light and smooth as 12yo. .The finish is sweet cream, fruit, honey, and more pepper than before, and it's long and rich enough to leave you wanting."
6173,Redbreast 15-year-old,"Room temperature when drinking: 17 ℃  Viewing Eyes: golden yellow  Smell Nose: At first it was fresh walnuts, green apples, pears, yeast dough, aloe yogurt. In the middle, the milky aroma of figs appears, similar to that of Atixian's fig perfume, with a large white rabbit toffee and daisies. It is amazing, with the lemon scent of mountain pepper and the scent of fresh pepper, the layers are clear and varied.  Taste Palate: a little water, maybe just drink 12CS. Low sweetness, white rabbit toffee, milk flakes, fresh milk, apple pie, banana cake, butter shortening, cinnamon cardamom and other wooden spices  Finishing Finish: Medium, pepper, tap water, Malan head, unsweetened fruit, and a hint of crispy corner ==  Body: Medium, medium-fat, thick, with tannin, less bitter base  Nose: 88/100  Palate: 87/100  Finish: 86/100  Body: 87/100  Overall: 87/100  Overall: It smells good, but it doesn't appeal to me enough."

A careful balance of first fill and refill casks accentuates the assorted spices within Redbreast’s characteristic full and complex flavour."
6175,Redbreast 15-year-old,This whiskey has a very different profile from the rest of the range. A profile that is also quite woody and definitely not to my taste.

6177,Redbreast 15-year-old,"Another great 15-year-old Readbreast (2019). Even more berries compared to older versions.Concerning price/performance ratio: 9/10Sweet fruity sherry. Berries (gooseberry, blackberry most of the time), ripe apples, caramel, raisins, roasted almonds.Sweet fruity sherry again. Berries cooked and stewed. Some leather way in the back.Medium. Red and dark fruit gums. Some vegetables in the back."
6178,Redbreast 21-year-old,"Always a real pleasure to have the 21yo in the glass. Over the years that it has been on the market, the tropical fruits have shifted from nose to tongue, which can be mourned a bit. But this did not create a “gap” in the nose, so that the oldest (standard) robin, aged 21, can still be offered a home with a clear conscience.  After the solo tasting, a quick comparison with a 21yo from 2016: there's not really much going on. I feel the current 21yo is a bit creamier and denser, the aroma selection is congruent, but in the current version it seems a bit more accentuated.  2016: 90/100  2019: 91/100He greets the nose with sherry-saturated figs and plums. The smell of an old leather bag. Musk. The moment you wonder where, please, the spices stay, they start to appear: cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, cloves, marjoram, nutmeg, ginger. The nose builds up gently, still expanding the aroma spectrum by one more nuance, always finding a connection with the aromas that have already come to light. Raisins are now added to the figs and plums. Dark chocolate flakes, coffee beans, some furniture polish.Creamy, syrupy texture. Still looks lighter on the tongue than on the nose, because now the missing tropical fruits appear in the nose: mango, papaya, passion fruit, peach, banana, dragonfruit. This garnished with the pot still spices, which show on the tongue with the same intensity as in the nose, makes the 21yo. Peach and mango stand out now, a delicious mango chutney is formed. Jaffakekse. A little bit of wood; not too much. Takes a little creaminess. Leather, tobacco notes. Warm milk coffee.Long, still creamy, an echo of the tropical fruits. Ginger, dried plums, dark chocolate - and then the fruits turn up again, they had already been written off."
6179,Redbreast 21-year-old,"Toast with honey, unripe mango, loquat, sugar apple with a touch of starfruits and yellow plum, but unfortunately it smelled a bit mentholated. Sweet wood, hay, some light spices, vanilla and pomelo peel. Cantaloupe became obvious after breathing in the glass for 30+ min.Loquat, starfruit and sugar apple. The flavour didn't last long on the palate, the sweetness dropped and pomelo peel became obvious with a hint of citrus peel bitterness. Light spices were lingering in the background at the same time with the taste of burnt sweet wood.Passion fruits was prominent to begin with, some guava, followed by over-burnt vanilla that came with woody bitterness. A dash of green pickles."
6180,Redbreast 21-year-old,"Strong candidate without weaknesses and with an excellent nose, if you give him time and calm. The robin will now end up in the glass more often, even at the price level (nowadays) justified. Despite the aroma composition suitable for the masses, no beginner paints imho.  Cl a pleasure for Cl!Wow! Takes a little time to develop. Panning is harmful! When he calms down, the full depth comes.  The sweetness is reminiscent of some older good bourbons, caramel, pastries. This is followed by intense fruits, plum cake. Some milk chocolate, berries, pudding, raspberry soft cake. Then hides some spices, barrel maturation can be seen. Not a trace of alcohol. What bothers me ... nothing!  I'm already a little in love.  After the first sip, it is a bit spicier with a distinct coffee note - on the nutty side.Berries and vanilla on the nose before you swallow, followed by chocolate with a medium cocoa content, a little pepper is also included. Not as cute as the nose anymore. Spice, fruit and sweetness in a nice balance. Alcohol now also recognizable in contrast to the nose. Everything is confirmed with the second sip. Now also hazelnut flavors. I find it very ""enjoyable""It gets spicier. Intense reverberation, fruits fade away, the oak now predominates. Coffee, a rather dark roasted Sicilian espresso with sugar, washes down the berry cake. Or muffins? Vanilla flashes through again. This becomes more subtle in the second sip. But a few more fruits. Long, but not too long and not too bitter at all for 21 years."
6181,Redbreast 21-year-old,"Very fine, ripe whiskey for the discerning customer but also ideal for beginners. Calming and soft. As a nightcap.

Especially slightly bitter grapefruit.Nice wood aromas, bitter-sweet, mineral with coffee aromas"
6182,Redbreast 21-year-old,Extremely well done with loads of tropical fruit flavours. Still balanced and gentlemanlike.
6183,Redbreast 21-year-old,"Color: Light CopperNose: The label itself has succinct tasting notes: ""The intrigue of tropical fruit and wild berries with soft vanilla and a sherry nuttiness."" I think I've found this only a few times, but I have to say this is not bad! I'm sure I'd write much more to get there, but this is the crux of what you're getting. And it is truly a great nose, everything is in such wonderful balance. So while I've had Irish whiskies (single malts, not pot stills) that are just as fruity, and skewing tropical, that usually has been the predominant note. Indeed, some of those famed single malts from the late-'80s and early-'90s can be a bit monomaniacal. Some even bring a slightly unpleasant acetone smell. Nothing like that here. The fruits are beautiful and lush, but they're always accompanied by a pleasant vanilla. You imagine some of that vanilla is coming from active bourbon casks, and good ones at that. But the sherry has its say, as well. Beyond what's been listed thus far, I'd also add there's a minor metallic edge to the nose, which I almost always enjoy. Here is no exception. Water brings out a bit more sherry spice. Just an overall impressive nose due presumably to a quality spirit, good casks, and time.Taste: Juicy! Wow, perhaps the closest a whisk(e)y has ever come to approximating actual fruit juice for me. The 46% strength is just about bang-on, too. I'm not sure keeping it at cask strength would do much more for this given the profile. You don't want this too thin, but it's also not particularly meant to be gloppy (and I sometimes love that), in my opinion. While the nose really did a tremendous job combining tropical fruits and berries along with all sort of other, subtle accents, here it's the tropical fruits carrying the day. And that's fine. I don't rejoice over pure fruit bombs the way many commentators do, but when it's done this well and the nose offers that extra something, I can't do anything but conclude this is a huge success. I don't find water do much at this stage.Finish: The fruitiness lingers for a decently long time. Clean and refreshing, no bitterness whatsoever.Comments: Terrific. This is the sort of bottling that keeps me enthusiastic about whisk(e)y when there are increasingly so many reasons to lose interest. There aren't many a) official bottlings, b) in the core range, c) that present this level of quality, and d) aren't outrageously priced. While it would be nice if you didn't have to pay close to $200 for a bottle of this, there so many who charge much more exorbitant prices now. And this is truly widely-available. You're not waiting for it to drop at the retailers only to find it's sold out a few minutes later. When you combine all that with the uniquely Irish style, it's a benchmark and one that every serious collector should have in their stash at least once."

Then comes the sweet and sour fresh berries, red berries, sand tangerines, ripe apricot flesh, but the sugar is more restrained. Solid oak, yeast dough finally appeared, accompanied by freshly picked figs, its unique sweetness and frankincense reminded me of those charming fig perfumes.  Taste Palate: There is nothing to say. The first stage is mint, spearmint, perilla, and lavender. The second paragraph is honey pomelo, grapefruit, citrus, rosy grape, black currant juice. The third stage is the walnut pie, vanilla cheesecake, baking oak and fallen leaves.

6189,Redbreast Lustau Edition,"Unlike the 12yo, which takes a certain amount of time to develop, the Redbreast Lustau starts right in the nose and on the tongue. That he shoots his powder too quickly would be too harsh a judgment. But out the back and especially in the finish it turns out that a little household would not have been inappropriate.Baked plums, raisins and dried apricots are in the glass immediately after pouring. Toasted wood, mild liquorice pastilles, ginger, marjoram, savory, nutmeg, pepper, some lovage. A furniture polish lurks in the background, but luckily there is no way around the fruits and spices.The 6 volume percent more compared to the 12yo are clearly noticeable in a stronger mouthfeel. Not as creamy and silky as the 12yo. Dried plums, figs and apricots, almond chocolate, marzipan bread. Spreads its aromas generously, right from the start. Liquorice, ginger cookies, cocoa butter, toffee, cold coffee grounds.Becomes increasingly dry and goes on the spicy side. The liquorice notes are now clearly pronounced, a little menthol is added. Blackberry jam, charred wood shavings."
6190,Redbreast Lustau Edition,
6191,Redbreast Lustau Edition,"This reminds me of everything that I love in signature style of Redbreast, with extra sweetness and creaminess that makes it even more enjoyable. Many fans of Irish whiskey would be familiar with Redbreast 12 or even the Redbreast 12 Cask Strength. They would notice that the Lusteau is noticeably sweeter, more crisp and more estery in its aroma. The Oloroso finishing adds a component of rich and luscious red fruits that really stepped up the game and made this very tasty and unforgettable.This Redbreast is another liquid dessert that is sweet, rich, satisfyingly heavy bodied and effortless to drink.Link to Review: https://88bamboo.co/blogs/the-bamboo-post/redbreast-lustau-edition-46-0-obIn the glass, the whiskey is a bright amber colour.On the nose, this is bright, rich and estery. This leads with substantial vanilla with toasted almonds that grow in intensity. Taking centre stage are waves of honey, caramel and vanilla custard accompanied by an equal part of bright estery fruits- Saturn peaches and pineapples. There is a minor part of raisins and sultanas. Remarkably clean, fresh, bright and aromatic.The spirit is relatively crisp and honeyed, but there is also small touch of dark oakiness and chocolately notes; this takes some repeated nosing. Adding several drops of water coaxed these aromas out.On the palate, refreshingly crisp, sweet and velvety in texture. Taking a sip, the opening flavours are sweet, bright and estery in a distinctively Irish whiskey way that makes the flavours permeate your olfactory canal. A heap of vanilla shortbread and lashings of honey and butter, supported by rich and luscious raisins, sultanas and cherries that come through more distinctively in the palate. Interestingly, the sweet dark fruits are dominant on the palate but there is no dryness that usually follow. None of that red winey-leathery texture. Instead, we have sweet dark fruits supported by a creamy and velvety texture. The combination of the luscious dark fruits and honey reminds me of a raisin-topped sticky kouign amann.Great balance with a rich body and velvety texture.I really like the marriage of equals between the clean and sweet vanilla flavours on one hand and sweet sherry notes on the other.The remarkable difference in the Lusteau is really that there is no dryness or leatheriness that generally accompany sherried whiskies.The finish is long with the enduring sweetness of vanilla, raisins and pineapples. As the more lively notes subside, you start to detect light spices of cinnamon and ginger prickliness. There is also just a touch of bitter hoppiness you would get from a lager beer, that linger a little while on your tongue."

Originally I was very skeptical, but the flavor has improved it, it's just a bit more fruitful and woody. It's interesting in the smell, but then it sounds like a slightly unhealthy bitter patch.At first sight practically the same as the standard version - caramel, woodiness, light bourbon tinge. In the background, the horse stable and some of the green apple sweetness are the background. InterestinglyAgain, it comes out of the classic version, but adds more bitterness, fruity acidity / bitterness of green apples, gingerbread and fine cinnamonThere's nothing extra in the reverberation, woodiness, going into bitterness.

6208,Tullamore Dew Finest Old Irish Whiskey,Good solid Irish drinking whiskey. You can pick this up on a Tuesday evening and enjoy it without fear of breaking the bank. Yes it's a little bit rougher than your Redbreast 12 and Green Spot but I picked this up for £16 a bottle. You cannot complain at that price!In addition the dame of this is Tullamore D.E.W. and not Dew
6209,Tullamore Dew The Legendary Irish Whiskey,"Irish whiskey tends to be soft and 'green' in its style, and Tullamore Dew is no exception to this. Triple distillation has clearly diminished the roughness of the spirit, making it quite palatable. On the nose, there is not much happening. It's light and rather restrained with pronounced grassy and floral notes, mild fruitiness and a touch of vanilla. The taste is fresh, spicy and malty sweet, turning into a swift and straightforward finish that is characterized by zesty wood tannin bitterness. To conclude, it's a gentle but fairly simple blend without complexity.RATING: 2.7/5.0 stars ≙ 76 pts → SUBPAR [+]"

6211,Tullamore Dew The Legendary Irish Whiskey,"Talking about an entry sort of whiskey. This Irish gentleman is not as bad as the average score suggests in my opinion.Fruity, floral, light, barley, honey, cane sugar. It’s completely not complex nor deeply matured or anything but somehow it is pleasant. I’m rather surprised to be honest. Triple distillation took place for a gentlemans nose. Barley, bread crumbs, sweet tropical fruits like Pineapple and melon.Smooth, accessible, sweet. Vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, sweet apples and sweet tangerine juice. A wee bite of white pepper is there as well. Again it’s a gentleman.Medium length. That’s surprising since it’s young, 40% ánd triple distilled. Another windfall. Quite some friendly and sweet flavors here. Honey, vanilla, sweet apples, dough and more of these friendly flavors. Well, look; you have to see this into perspective. It’s less then €20 a bottle so it’s easy to say ‘this must be rubbish’. But I’m actually rather charmed by it’s simplicity and it certainly does not lack taste. My bottle is close to getting empty but I think I’ll buy another one when it is."

6237,Miltonduff 12-year-old  Pure Single Malt,"Here are the notes of a bottle I bought a few months ago as part of the Speyside Autumn Festival in Dufftown for £ 50. First the existing data:  Distillery: Miltonduff (Speyside)  Bottling: OA ""Pure Single Malt ""  Age: 12 years (bottled around the end of the 1980s)  Capacity: 0.75 liters (which I could not find listed anywhere ...)  Alcohol content: 43%  ... my expectations in advance: I appreciate Miltonduff very much for particularly older bottlings, which could always convince me, especially 1960s and 1970s bottlings. Whether this quit green bottle can keep up with that ... look who the 10-year-old Miltonduff, which is filled by Gordon & MacPhail as a quasi-standard, is finally inconspicuous, but very solid ...  Nose: Fruits, especially citrus outweigh, a slight herbal note, a hint of marzipan ..., nothing that bothers, even nothing that stands out  Palate: my grandmother would say very mild ..., no seriously the substance flows very supple over the tongue, there is nothing spicy or sprittig alcoholic, very pleasant to start ..., the Bachulke the fierce cask strengths could be preferred at the Maybe I complain that it would be 2-3 percent more ..., but I distract, we are at the taste ... It is this Old School orange note that is so common in older bottlings ..., you have to Think compote with tangerines, oranges and stuff that was always with Mum and after a few sips the tongue tingles a bit, the 43% are proving to be sufficient and the whole thing seems very round ...  Finish: ... I've already anticipated something, despite the low percentages he stays longer, the orange note remains ....  Conclusion: a perfect entry-level whisky for a tasting, but behave in full taste and with a lasting orange note. Certainly not quite the great cinema of his big brothers from the 1970s, but still good enough to show people how delicious 25 years ago could be the standard bottling of a single malt distillery. 85 points"

Further, a little gouache, light notes of burnt wood and a candle wax. Even further, unsweetened plum jam and a little fresh shavings come to the fore.  Taste: A little liquid after such an aroma, but nevertheless, it is extremely pleasant - plum jam, burnt caramel, nuts, coffee grounds and oak. It is complemented by peat and light burning. Too dry.  Finish: Slightly spoiled by plastic notes. In general, a little short, woody and spicy with peat, notes of sherry and nuts.  The wonderful development of the fragrance is supported by a slightly inferior, but keeping the brand taste. The finish does not hold out, but the picture does not spoil much, in general - this is the major league."

If you like a fruity, minty and slightly waxy dram with some dried fruit, it may suit you very well.The nose is quite friendly, in the Miltonduff style. Don't expect an explosion of flavours, it's quite modest. It's mostly bourbon-driven, but has some sherry influence. Vanilla and toasted coconut are most prominent, along with mint and yellow fruit. Wood, allspice and dried fruit (raisin) complete the nose.Medium bodied, rather rounded, and smooth. It starts of quite juicy on juicy raisins and yellow fruit, then it gets creamier with butter, vanilla and pastry notes. After that, was and mint follow.

That he is only 40% amazes me; the smell suggests a higher percentage. The bottle is bottled in the Ballantine's series; it is a purveyor, so to speak, of Ballantine's, the blenders that worldwide have a larger market share than all Single Malt whiskys combined. The first sip is mild, softly sweet, with a touch of smoke on the front of the tongue. Now the 40 percent is recognizable. It doesn't have a real punch, there are some nut flavors and a bit of tobacco. The aftertaste is short and businesslike; a warm, satisfying wood glow remains in your mouth.

Finish: Sweet and spicy, hides alcohol well. With Water: Becomes sweeter and milder but not recommended generally. Overall: Very unique and delicious.

6318,Taketsuru Pure Malt,"This was really good, I must say during that whole Japanese whisky boom, I did get a little jaded especially with prices just climbing like Tesla shares. So when this came out, I was mildly hesitant, but for the price, what the hey. And that turned out to be such a good call. This was such a strong showing and I can’t rave about it enough.Some people scoff at NAS bottlings but trust me, this just took the cake. Wonderfully complex with all the right notes, it didn’t feel forced or suffered at the hands of some accelerated maturation. Yet its Japanese profile was distinctive from the nose and so nostalgic.Bottomline, light yet complex, plays all the right notes, it hits the sweet spot for most Asian palate, price is great as well. Link to review: https://88bamboo.co/blogs/the-bamboo-post/taketsuru-pure-malt-whisky-2020-release-nas​Visually, a clear light straw yellow, not very viscous. But not atypical of Japanese whiskies either.​​On the nose, it starts with a slight alcoholic tinge so I’m gonna just let it cool down a little and leave it to rest. A few minutes in, it’s certainly simmered down, the alcoholic twang is gone, thank god. It’s replaced by that characteristic musky mizunara that people like to say smells like wooden shrines. But yeah gotta give it to these marketers, it really do be smelling that way.A lot of honey as well, it’s also fruity, like green apples, apricot, blackberries. It’s very light, sweet and slightly tart buoyed by that oaky musk. Really such a great nose.​​On the palate, it’s light bodied, but oh boy does it pack a punch. At first sip it’s sweet and delicate, you do taste the honey you got on the nose, alongside this fragrant vanilla and jasmine. It’s somewhat like Pokka’s green tea. Then it develops to becoming a lot spicier and that’s where the kick is at. It grows into this little fireball that warms your throat.After that fireball simmers down, there’s this really nice soft coconut shaving, much like Ondeh Ondeh, know that desiccated coconut that coats the surface. There’s BBQ tropical fruits as well, like pineapples and pears. What’s interesting is there’s also peat which caught me by surprise. It’s a very gentle smoke that stays on after you’re done and it’s alittle salty at that. This is surprisingly very complex but so good. Like seriously, what?!​The finish is medium, it’s not too short but yet doesn’t overstay. It goes down so smooth but when that fireball is put out, all those really wonderful subtle layers come out, like that toasty coconut shavings and the grilled tropical fruits and let’s not forget that whiff of smoke that is just slightly salty. What gets you is that right after the fireball goes down and you think you’re done, man oh man, it was just intermission! There’s a full second half left!"
6319,Taketsuru Pure Malt,

6321,Mortlach 12-year-old  The Wee Witchie,"MogwaiFor years Mortlach was only available as a 16 Year old in the Flora & Fauna series, but in 2015 Diageo decided to ‘premiumise’ the brand. It was replaced by a NAS (Rare Old), and 18 and 25 years old, but the prices were so high that the bottles gathered dust on the shelves. So Diageo rethought their strategy and replaced the core range once more with an (more) affordable 12, 16 and 20 years old. I’ll gladly try them for you. Let me start with the 12 Year Old, named The Wee Witchi after the small No 1 Wines Still with a contents of a mere 7.880 liters.The nose is fruity and sweet on sugared oranges, plums, sultanas with a soft note of vanilla. Pretty creamy. Some cinnamon and nutmeg. Hint of pencil shavings and banana peel.Creamy and quite spicy on nutmeg, ginger and woodspice on the palate. Less sweet than the nose announce. More like sweet & sour. Lovely notes of orange marmalade, chewing tobacco and some gooseberries. I light bitterness as well. Nice.Pretty long finish that allows the bitter note to continue and leaves the mouth fairly dry. Luckily it is sweet enough to not become astringent. It does remain quite spicy.Despite the young age, this Mortlach is already quite round and spicy with a good body. The Mogwai of the series."
6322,Mortlach 12-year-old  The Wee Witchie,"Notes of chalk and sour cherries, with a hint of pencil shavings and saw dust. A whiff of raisins and sultanas, as well as a touch of honey, cinnamon, and some pronounced orange peel.A whiff of ginger, followed by caramel and orange marmalade. Finally a touch of burnt toast, cigar tobacco and pencil shavings.A tad dry, spicy and with a pinch of oak."
6323,Mortlach 12-year-old  The Wee Witchie,"Since I basically like Mortlach, I was happy to have this dram in my glass.  Color: golden caramelPeach, orange zest, fudge, malt, cherry, raisinsCaramel, raisins, steak, white pepper, cakemedium length, slightly acidic, oak, plum"
6324,Mortlach 12-year-old  The Wee Witchie,"Color: Burnished  The same conclusion as at the chat-Stammtisch: There are worse 12 year old, but also better for less money. Tastes much better than last time, 84 points. The burnt note in the nose is a bit cheap.Orange peel, malt. Tart, unripe prunes, burnt bread. For 12 years relatively heavy and spicy, ginger and nutmeg. A fine vanilla note.Neat volume in the mouth, not watery, more nutmeg, polished oak, bitter orange jam. Sourish, gooseberries and unripe plums.Medium-long, latte, blockade. Unspectacular."

6326,Mortlach 12-year-old  The Wee Witchie,A really fun and happily sippable malt which despite its low strength reveals more and more of its potential like a surprising long mid palate and finish. Bravo! But prob a bit too expensivefor what it is.
6327,Mortlach 12-year-old  The Wee Witchie,"(Sample tasting of how long the bottle was open before I don't know.) I approached this malt with relatively neutral expectations and was pleasantly surprised! Very varied and strong aromas. Not really cheap, but it can really do something for a 12 year old.Powerful on the nose with intense and relatively heavy fruit notes. In addition, there are clear spices and a pleasant, profound sweetness. The flavors range from fresh to darker and preserved fruits. Oranges, spicy wood, slightly floral and herb-like, light dried fruits, some wood shavings. Maybe a little fruity tobacco. A great and harmonious mixture! I like it very much.Pleasantly spicy, orange or citrus notes, very light herbal notes. Fresh, but also somewhat boiled down fruit notes, slightly tart. Maybe a little fruity tobacco here too.Pleasantly bitter and slightly spicy. Generally soft and comfortable."
6328,Mortlach 12-year-old  The Wee Witchie,"The bourbon barrel is much brighter than the sherry. Definitely let it breathe whisky. Fresh: 84 points. Breathing: 86 points.Fresh: sherry-oak mix, duchesses, acetones, sharp, oak  Breathing: fresh  With water: nothing changesFresh: sweetness, pungency, burning, duches, fruit caramel, barberry  Breathing: spiciness, fruit sweetness, bitterness of oak bark, yeast and malt tones, tobacco leaves  With water: the sweetness leaves, pleasant lemon sourness is addedFresh: duchess, barrel, long  Breathing: simpler, oak, peanuts  With water: peanuts"

6331,Mortlach 16-year-old  Distiller's Dram,"[November, 2018] The 16-years old Mortlach of the Flora & Fauna series is (probably) the most legendary Mortlach release because of its perfect combo of massive sherry and bold malt flavours - a real stunner in the Traditional Scotch style (and I guess many casks were paxarette improved, what is absolutely fine with me). But then Diageo cancelled this release and tried to re-position Mortlach as a premium malt with super-premium prices (and 0.5 litre bottles only). The quality of these ""high-end"" bottlings was rather chequered and luckily the consumers refused the join in that game (what is not usual during these crazy whisky boom times). Guess what? Diageo reacted and re-positioned Mortlach with the new 12, 16 and 20-years old releases in the middle of the market (again) what is absolutely okay. Hey, consumers still have power in the whisky world - a triple hooray and a big Mortlach dram on that, slainte!This new Mortlach 16-years old is completely different from the old Flora & Fauna edition (less sherry-driven) but it is a very Traditional Scotch style dram that is flawless (no sulphur-spoiled cask in this batch what is a great achievement for Mortlach that is infamous for many sulphurous drams), it is perfectly balanced and dangerously quaffable. To be honest, I fell in love with this dram from the very first sip on and this did not change until now (when half of the bottle is gone already). It is neither the most complex nor the most impressive whisky but it is what whisky should be: Easy to sip, delicious and very, very enjoyable... PS: Always remember there are many different batches of such standard drams - my review is on batch L8283DM002 (bottling hall code on the bottom of the back side of the bottle) that was bottled on October 10th, 2018. Later releases might be quite different (see my review on batch L9016 WB id 130617)...The colour is russetmuscat (with the help of caramel as stated on the german label) and the nose offers a flawless modern sherry profile with bold toffee and malty aromas. There are spicy and waxy notes too, all in all a delicious and balanced profile.The taste is rich on both clean sherry and toffee-vanilla malt flavours in a close-to-perfection mix. No flaw or off-note that I can find, this simply is quaffable without ""analysis paralysis"" before - a malt that demands what it is destined for: to be enjoyed in good company! Water is not needed.The arrival of the dram is very creamy and nicely coating without any distracting feeling. The finish is long and vanishes slowly without any distracting feeling. Congrats to a honest and (hopefully) successful repositioning of this fine malt, Diageo - and by the way, I like the bottle design..."
6332,Mortlach 16-year-old  Distiller's Dram,"The Beast of Dufftown in its new cloak - boy, that rebranding was so desperately needed. To hell with Mortlach's ultra-premium deluxe image! On the nose, blood oranges, cloves and heather jump at you. Raspberries, sage and honey follow shortly after, and there is an earthy note creeping in. Full-bodied and intense, the palate guides you through the flavor wheel: fruity, bitter and sour, then savory, sweet and slightly dry. Tangerine, peppermint and a touch of stout escort the long and cask-dominated finish. A great comeback of a characterful Speysider.RATING: 4.0/5.0 stars ≙ 88 pts → FIRST-CLASS"
6333,Mortlach 16-year-old  Distiller's Dram,"DarjeelingThis 16 Year Old – dubbed the Distiller’s Dram – should make us forget the 16 years old from the Flora & Fauna series. That will not be easy, as that was a top dram. This new one is likewise matured on sherry casks, but has a slightly higher ABV.The nose is round and elegant, almost feminine. Softer than the 12 Year Old with much more sweetness. The sherry casks have done a good job. Overripe banana, orange marmalade, toffee and toffee apples, but also apricots, plums and sultanas. Some earthy and wood glue, but in the good sense. Refined and complex.Succulent! Dark and sweet on sultanas, dried apricots, juicy cherries, blood oranges and plums upholstered with some cloves and cinnamon. Then I get some hazelnuts and a bitterness as if from Darjeeling tea that has been left unattended. You can almost chew this one. Very good!The finish is long, dark and sweet with some drying tannins at the death.Refined. Elegant. Feminine. Wonderful. Complex yet dangerously quaffable. Offer this at cask strength and it will truly be The Wild Child of Speyside."

Solid sherry and wood notes at a weak alcohol level.If you take the money into account, this is horrible on so many levels.Mortlach used to be awesome; till they wanted to aim for the upper price market and offered those stupid 0,5 bottles for high prices... now they offer 0.7 bottles for stupid prices...If you want to spend that kind of money with mortlach, stick to the independant bottlers (namely Chieftains).From the new range an price/performance wise the Mortlach 16 was the best, but still quite bad (80€ for 16 years at 44%)"

6344,Mortlach 20-year-old  Cowie's Blue Seal,"CivilizedThe new 20 Year Old is dubbed Cowie’s Blue Seal, which is a reference to one of the former owners, who later became mayor of Dufftown and left the distillery to his son.Wonderfully aromatic nose on old, dusty books, a drop of blood, orange peel and a very delicate not of wild flowers, even some potpourri. Cocoa and dark caramel. On overripe fig. But creamy and delicate at the same time – if that makes sense.Creamy on the palate, with a soft spiciness (nutmeg and pepper) and dark fruit in the guise of figs, raisins and dried apricots. Some pine sap and menthol. A mild drying effect from the oak.In the medium long finish it’s again the oranges that have the final say.Lovely Mortlach, but not exactly the Beast of Dufftown. This one is very civilized. I did notice that the new range is a lot less ‘meaty’ than some independent bottlings of Mortlach. Seems to me this is a conscious choice, as the 12 and 16 years old (my fav) lack that umami side as well."
6345,Mortlach 20-year-old  Cowie's Blue Seal,"A hint of copper coins and sour beer, but also a touch of leather-bound books, dark caramel and cocoa powder.

6351,808 Single Grain Scotch Whisky,"The 808 Drinks Company, 55 DruryLane, London WC2B 5RZ, UKThe 808 Single Grain Scotch Whiskey is a mild Scotch Whiskey that can be drunk pure, but is also great for mixing. It was developed jointly by DJ and music producer TommyD, Jonathan Driver and the North British Distillery. The gold-colored single grain is characterized by its light but expressive character and its multi-layered aromas with notes of honey, chocolate and vanilla. The 808 Single Grain has an alcohol content of 40 percent and comes in a 0.7 l bottle with a minimalist design.The name is also inspired by the TR-808 drum machine, which is known to every fan of electronic music. Like the drum machine in music, the 808 single grain is the sub bass for drinks.The 808 Single Grain Scotch Whiskey was launched by Tommy Asher Danvers, better known as TommyD. The successful British DJ, music producer and songwriter, who is also part of the electro soul band Graffiti6, pursued the idea that music and a special whiskey could bring people together to change the world. He founded the 808 Drinks Company with his business partner Paul Pullinger. The two makers then put together a team of whiskey specialists, music experts and creatives to create their exciting new whiskey. The result is fantastic and the 808 Single Grain is the perfect beat for any party."

6353,Crown Vat 20-year-old,"From the pamphlet: “More than two decades ago, with particular care, J. Sykes selected and brought in several famous Single Malt Whiskies, allowing them to mature for nearly 15 years before blending. Only now is this very special blend made available, in celebration of Higsons Bicentenary Year”. J. Sykes and Co were wine and spirit merchants out of Liverpool active between 1906-1986 according to national archives. Business must have been good because J. Sykes and Co bought Higsons Brewery in 1918, which at the time was already almost 140 years old. Business continued to flourish until they were eventually bought out and the Brewery closed in 1989 after nearly 210 years. 1980 was Higsons Bicentenary, which is what this bottle is celebrating and it would be reasonable to assume 1979/1980 is when it was bottled. Based on the little pamphlet attached ‘several famous malt whiskies’ were matured for nearly 15 years before blending (in 1966), which means at least some of these casks were early 50’s distillate. Distilleries which include: Ardbeg, Highland Park, Glen Grant, Tomatin, Glenlivet, North British and Cameronbridge. Little piece of History, this."

Then I get lemons, but also a hint of coconut. Nougat. Almonds in the back and caramel. Later also peach.A creamy mouthfeel with whipped cream and vanilla. Slightly watery though, but less than I expected. A bit of caramel fudge. Lemons and also oranges. Followed by minerals and a touch of chalk. A pinch of sea salt and almonds again.Short to mid-long with salt, caramel and lemons."

Soft spices, little bit of salty, mild medicinal bitterness.Quickly diminishes, warming, savoury,"
6370,Old Pulteney 15-year-old  The Maritime Malt,"A very beautiful nose is continued on the palate with the formidable bourbon and sherry barrel interplay, supplemented by bakery sweetness and delicate maritime seasoning. Is for me on at least one stage with the 17er. The nice thing is: You can enjoy this malt ""just like that"" and you can also ""disassemble it in its entirety"". If you like Glenfarclas without sherry turbo (ie the 25's from the standard range or older 4th-Fill-Casks), you should also like this malt.Clear, maritime, coastal spicy. And still with the shot of sherry and bakery flavors. So to speak the 17er, the direction 25er-Pulteney goes. If the 2006 ""pure Bourbonpulteney pure"", this is now the (also for the 17er) also typical ""crystal clear-maritime Pulteney-Bourbon-and-Sherryfass-Melange"".Very enjoyable! Crystal clear, now with sherry sweets and bakery that goes into vanilla. Everything is beautifully mint fresh primed with the pulteneytypischen 46%. The oak comes too. Then again sherry, cinnamon and a pinch of sea salt. Amazingly full for his 15 years and then again slightly in enjoyment. The balance between sherry and bourbon keg is absolutely successful.In the medium-long finish, then the oak again with some espresso."
6371,Old Pulteney 15-year-old  The Maritime Malt,"The smell is fresh and yet not young. That starts well. The taste blends in harmoniously and also the finish fits wunservoll to the overall picture.  A very nice, mild ex-bourbon whisky, which, despite its mildness, is very full of character. I am positively surprised.The whisky smells ""green"", lime, tangerine, woodruff some oak, fresh green herbslight, soft body, but noticeably mild and offensive, the aromas from the smell are repeated, mandarin and lime, a little malt, light oakslightly bitter, the fruits are still in the delicate memory, the oak takes over the direction"

A very nice sherry oriented dram, with depth. Quite different from the 17 year old it ‘replaces’ , but still very good indeed. If I would be pressed I would choose the 17 by a really narrow margin, maybe since old habits are hard to rid o"
6374,Old Pulteney 15-year-old  The Maritime Malt,No notes tasted at a show.Don`t bother with the 18 year this is cheaper and better when compared side by side.
6375,Old Pulteney 15-year-old  The Maritime Malt,"with water: the malt becomes salty and the fruity notes become more intense, especially citrus fruits. However, it loses its good balance, so I would leave out the water Conclusion: a very good and delicious standard whisky with a nice balance, for me almost a benchmark when it comes to maritime malts without the influence of peat. However, I can hardly find any references to the Spanish oak barrels, which only have a slight influence herefresh with aromas of the sea breeze, some salt, some hay, a few flowers, plus vanilla and biscuit notes, coconut can also be found, every now and then a few hazelnut aromas drop by, but only very weakly, honey, and the oak scatters a few Clove flavors with it, some fresh mintit starts off rather weakly, but then the maritime aromas break out, plus a few light fruits (pear), honey, malt / grain and, very subtle, oakMedium length, notes of vanilla and biscuit, pear, marzipan, caramel, light oak flavor"

6381,Old Pulteney 18-year-old  The Maritime Malt,"That was non-love at first sight. Maybe the Malt wins with a lot of oxygen, time and habituation. Anyone who likes strong, rubber-sweet malts with sulfur will also like this Pulteney. I like that less now. You can try, but you do not have to.  The 18er stands out from the Pulteney range and seems to me already ""designed"". Also, the price of around 120 euros (as of 02/2019) is based on the current market situation. There I find the new 15-year-old Pulteney (ID: 116460) the basically better and for the distillery much more characteristic malt.Really now? On the first nose the full rubber abrasion, sweetness with sulfur. That could be one of those rubberized edradours! I did not have such a nose on any Pulteney. Ok, after an hour in the glass and a lot of panning, there are still a few Bourbon Bar flavors; but the rubber nose (children's dinghy: a lot of ice cream and sunscreen) covers everything. So I'm really looking forward to this taste ...In the mouth, the 18er then plays all his strength, brand Sherrykracher. Also sweet, but no longer as sweet as in the nose, now plum roaster and black berry. Similar in short moments to a refill sherry keg like the Fassstark Clynelish (ID: 121497). And at the second sip then again this Edradour rubber boat sweetie. Of matches.In the finish is again supplemented with oak, before appear again these artificial sweet notes. Somehow I'm sensitive to something like that. If you like that, ok. I find the 18er Pulteney less successful after the first drams in mouthfeel and finish."

6383,Old Pulteney 18-year-old  The Maritime Malt,"Distillery tasting.This is a very good whisky, unfortunately a bit too expencive.Although different in taste, I feel the 15YO is of a similar quality and hence better value.Clean, sophisticated sherry nose.Dark chocolate, plums, raisins.The softer fresh fruity Pultney character is hard to detect.Not extreme in any way, but kind of compact, may benefit from some time in the glass.Rounded soft and sweet.Coffee, fruit cake, orange chocolate.It's a whisky on which you probably could really go to town disecting its complexity, or you can simply just enjoy itMedium+ lenght slowly fading without any dram.Chocolate and sherry notes rounding off nicely."
6384,Old Pulteney 18-year-old  The Maritime Malt,"In the smell similar to the old Old Pulteney 17yo. Milk chocolate, perfume, grapes, banana.  As for the taste, also the typical Old Pulteney, very similar to 17yo. More sour, less sweet and astringent. Pear, nectarine, apricot, vanilla cream and salty caramel.  Evaluated only on the basis of a sample in the Whisky Festival 2019 in Malá Morávka, however, on the first occasion I would like to submit it to a more thorough examination."
6385,Old Pulteney 18-year-old  The Maritime Malt,"Very smooth and gentle, but with a full taste. Clearly some sherrycask influence.Very fruity, peach, tropical fruits, honey. Then the sherrycask influence comes in, more coffee, chocolate and prunes.Very soft and smooth, only a little pepper, without being thin. Full and creamy structure, sweet, honey, and later on some prunes.Again soft and smooth, honey, some sherry influences remain, prunes and some chocolate. Middle long."

6387,Old Pulteney 18-year-old  The Maritime Malt,"Lovely and delicious. Provides a sense of place. Wonderful fruit, balanced with a hint of smoke. Long enough to remind you of what you had.Plenty of fruit up front, starting with sweet orange and orange peel. The fruit smell dominates with some baking spice coming through.First impression is strong citrus well rounded by the impact of the oak. Some vanilla and even brown sugar. Though of salt.Not super long but long enough."
6388,Old Pulteney 18-year-old  The Maritime Malt,Dark mahogany color. Strong tea. The whisky in the glass is quite oily.A clear influence of Sherry Oloroso. Lots of dried fruit. Raisins.

6390,Port Ellen  1st Release  Diageo Special Releases 2001,"[March, 2019] Somehow I am in the mood for something special today and so I opened a sample of this legendary bottling......and yes, this is a special dram. It offers the PE profile at its best and despite it is rather austere it is both interesting and very quaffable (provided you like sweet, peaty and dry profiles). Is it worth today's four digit price? Well, it all depends on your pockets. I will certainly not buy a bottle at these ridiculous collector's and investor's prices - I will wait until the recent bubble implodes (remember: in human history there was never ever such a thing like an endless boom)...The colour is deep gold and the nose offers the trademark Port Ellen profile of sweet barley sugary, tarry and slightly rubbery (old tyres) aromas. Later some shy fruity (unripe plums and apples) and mossy notes join in and the typical chalky-metal touch which is somehow a PE characteristic. A complex and balanced nose that is very interesting to explore and delicious to sniff - great stuff, indeed! After some breathing it gets dryer on cold smoke and medicinal aromas (plaster, bandages).The taste is multi-layered on sweet barley sugars first followed by the tarry and rubbery flavours before some fruits step in and finally the hot spices take over (chili, white pepper, ginger). The peat smoke is there all the time and turns the taste more and more dry over time. In a later layer the trademark PE cold copper pops up and stays until the very end of the finish. The sweetness has vanished almost completely now. Water releases waxy and mineral aromas in the nose and turns the taste sweeter-smoother through reducing the dryness and adding some chocolatey flavours. Actually, I like this dram both neat and somewhat reduced to about 46% abv.The arrival on the palate is charming and instantly coats the whole of the mouth with a fine creamy feeling without any distracting moment. The finish is very long and strenghtens the sweet flavours again which is great. And some maritime notes of salt and seaweed pop up that are delicious. Towards the end it gets very dry on cold ashes and cold metals (copper) but this is rather a pleasant dryness and not too astringent."

6392,Port Ellen  1st Release  Diageo Special Releases 2001,"Amazing dram, hard to find any flaws in it.Review: https://youtu.be/Upzfboy5ZGUThe first thing is fresh oysters, some minerality, and brine. Then very light smoke, light medicinal note, a bit of lemon oil, fresh hay, more camphor, smoked vanilla, smoked oyster, hot summer tires, smoked herbs and peppers. Surprisingly mineral. Slightly more herbal and flowery after tasting.Not considering the price, this is a world class dram. It's quite clean and not as complex as other Port Ellens, but the balance is out of this world. Starts off with light medicinal notes, light peat smoke, a very good dose of cane sugar sweetness, lots of barley sugar, alcohol level just right, it's warm and full without biting too hard. A light note of ginger as well. Second chew is just marvellous. Smoke building up more, barley sugar keeps blasting away, more ginger, a bit of black pepper, light toffee notes, vanilla, brine, very light lemon oil. I can count on one hand the whiskies I've had with a better balance than this. Third chew is fuller, has a bit more ginger and black pepper, but it's so juicy my mouth is watering even after it's gone. Smoke and medicinal notes further up a level, the oysters are coming back, slightly fragrant brine. Really a wonderful dram through and through.Light medicinal notes, perfect amount of peat smoke, barley sugar is still there, very light note of steamed carrots, a bit of butterscotch, some brine, light herbal notes, still good minerality."

It tastes great. All the flavors described above follow each other. Here is the wax and it contains apples, honey, smoke, burnt rubber. And there is no dominance of any one taste, or aroma.

Green, fresh accents of lime, bergamot, maritime sea aromas, some algae and seaweed, as well as dull rope and peat. There is also vanilla and a fine minerality. Getting better on the move after breathing for a long time, but far from the best PE nose!  Taste:  Creamy fat, powerfully salty, spicy and extremely polarizing. Vanilla and lime combined with peat, phenol-laden smoke and iodine. Here the peat content is enormously high and mixes primarily in the entire taste - dry-gray-linear and somehow different from the subsequent releases - but that's fun again - great!  Finish:  Long - dry peaty and rather unusual metallic here too. The fruit content and the peat content are now declining and the finish ends quite dry.

Immediately spicy-mineral with organic matter and oak-herbal bitterness and astringency. Finish: Long, sweet-salty with organic matter, peat and marine minerality. On the exhale, smoke, smoked meats, tobacco, dry oak, shortbread cookies, zest, fried nuts, notes of smoked fish and spicy herbs.

More vigorous too, with a herbaceous side (freshly cut grass). Then we smell peat and finally green fruits and lemon. Maybe less complex than others. With water: even more anise! Not on the pastis, but on an anisette (style anisette Gras). Really an atypical profile. Not unpleasant, but atypical. The animal notes present in the other releases finally appear.The burn of alcohol is there. We find the anise present on the nose, as well as lemon and herbaceous bitterness.

6430,Port Ellen  5th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2005,"[October, 2020] My little dog passed away aged 15 (which is very old for dogs) this morning - she was healthy and enjoying life until the very end. Most probably she was the only dog who visited ALL distilleries in Scotland in person, and many of them several times. So I salute this exceptional dog with one of the most exceptional whiskies which is gone too (a long time ago) - may my dog enjoy a rebirth into another life just like Port Ellen is rebuild these days. Fibi was one of the best dogs in the world, R.I.P.[September, 2017]  Election day in Germany and it seems as if the great consensus has ended (GroKo - the two big coalition parties Conservatives and Social Democrats have both dramtically lost).  Perhaps I have to drink more rum in the future (because the most likely new government is nick-named Jamaica coalition).  So I have to empty my saved whisky samples quickly and I will start with a stunning pairing:  This 5th OB release of Port Ellen versus the 7th OB release (WB id 638)......which are two great and absolutely adorable drams that force me NOT to join the (Jamaica) rum coalition and keep faith with my beloved Scotch whisky.The colour of the 5th is one shade darker at yellow gold than the 7th that is old gold. The texture of the 7th shows a fat sticky ring at the top of the glass that very slowly transforms into sticky fat tears that very slowly build legs (this is a great oiliness!). The 5th shows many small sticky tears at the top of the glass that slowly consolidate into bigger tears with very slow moving legs (a very good oiliness, too). The nose of the 5th offers an adorable honey-sweet and maritime-peaty profile with lots of different aromas in a superb balance. The 7th is much more shy on the nose on a comparable profile that shows some more floral and fruity aromas. The nose of the 5th gets more shy after a while too, so both are best nosed immediately after opening the bottle. I like the 5th a little better than the 7th.The 7th offers a rich and unbelievable complex flavours profile that is truly multi-layered. The 5th owns about the same complexity of aromas on the palate and rolls in different waves over my taste buds, too. No flaws or off-notes that I can detect in both drams. I go for a draw. Water is not needed on the 7th as it turns the dram flatter and releases minor drying moments (papers) so I like it best when neat. The 5th improves on some water added and releases more floral-herbal aromas in the nose and some nice chocolatey flavours in the finish, too. This one I like better when reduced to about 46% abv.The 7th arrives bold and immediately mouth-coating on the palate with some (rather nice) peppery moments. The 5th has a warming and coating mouthfeel too but the texture is a little thinner than that of the 7th. This round takes the 7th. Both have a very long finish with no bitter or drying notes at all. The 5th is quite sweet on honey flavours surrounded by peaty and spicy aromas. The finish of the 7th offers more floral-herbal aromas that nicely join in the overall complex flavours mix that still is greatly balanced and harmonic. Both drams literally stick to the throat and provide a long-lasting tasting experience. Again I like the 7th a little bit more but with some water added the 5th catches up to be on par with the 7th."
6431,Port Ellen  5th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2005,"[April, 2017]  Another head-to-head tasting day, this time two highly praised Port Ellen - this OB 5th release (25 years old) versus a 27 years old MoS edition (WB id 18542)......which was a head-to-head on an exceptional high quality level.  It proves that Port Ellen malts age in dignity.The OB is significantly darker than the MoS and both noses are simply to adore. Typical PE style and very complex and rounded. The MoS has a slightly more powerful profile while the OB is more balanced with a wider aromas spectrum. I find the OB more spectacular (but the vanilla and metallic spike of the MoS is great, too).The taste of the MoS again is less complex and very sweet with this trademark metallic PE taste (coppery). The OB is a real stunner on the palate: An almost uncountable number of different aromas and flavours charm my taste buds, all in great harmony. Perfectly balanced, simply exceptional stuff. Here the OB is unbeatable and wins with several points ahead...Bold and mouth-coating arrival on both drams. Here I prefer the mouthfeel of the MoS over the OB as it is slightly more rich. The finish is long, longer, the longest with the OB. It turns a little drying towards the end (cold ashes) but this is okay, rather a nice supplement than unpleasant. The MoS is defeated again, but it is a proud runner-up. Very long finish too on sweet vanilla and peaty notes - a great combo."

They stand toe to toe and are the favorite expressions of the series I have tried so far."

6449,Port Ellen  6th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2006,"This is part of Diageo?s 2006 batch of Special Releases. Like Brora, Port Ellen distillery closed in 1983, and also represents a real loss for most malt aficionados. Some of us even consider it the best of all the Islays. This is the oldest bottling of Port Ellen ever undertaken by Diageo. Typically balanced and well mannered on the nose, with a restrained peat smokiness and maritime, medicinal characteristics. Soft and yielding on the viscous palate, with apricots and plus emerging alongside peat, subtle smokiness and brine. At its best neat, despite its strength, though water releases more of a maritime dimension.

Earthy, smoky, delicate maritime notes, lemon juice, sweet pineapple and apples.  Taste: Rich, creamy lemon syrup, instantly salty and spicy with some bitter aromas of orange peel. Then the peat also starts, and the PE gets a little bit more crazy. Harmonious round mouthfeel.  Finish: Pretty long, but with the slightly bitter orange note. Garden herbs, sea salt, smoky peaty lemon and a little wood. Dry peat is left behind.  Note: If the slightly bitter orange is not - The dry peat taste in the finish is the best!  90 points (nose: 89 / taste: 90 / finish: 91)"
6453,Port Ellen  6th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2006,"(Tasted in comparison with Elements of Islay PE5)Surprisingly subtle and subdued; needs some time to breathe. Mostly maritime and medicinal notes, with some light fruitiness.Sweetly peated; age showing here. No peat monster, no tar. Fresh lemon, waxy, tingling pepper, but mostly on salt and coastal notes.Long and intense for such a whisky with such a light fragrance! The best part IMHO. Very mouth-coating and enduring, with the peat easing more onto the foreground, vying with the salt, lemon and pleasant spices."
6454,Port Ellen  6th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2006,"[August, 2021] A quick review of a sample......which is another high-quality Port Ellen from long-gone times. Nice to sip, but way too expensive these times.The colour is jonquiripe corn and the nose offers the trademark PE profile with impressive maritime-peaty notes (iodine, smoked fish) beside the fruits and barley sugars. Very complex as usual, but less ""dirty"" than other releases. It takes its time to enfold so I suggest to wait at least 20 minutes to catch all aromas.The taste is complex and balanced with peaty and waxy flavours teaming up fruits and sugars and spices and ... All is perfect, not a single off-note that I can detect but it is a little less interesting than other releases. Water flattens the nose quickly but releases more flavours (citric fruits, herbs) on the palate. I prefer to nose this dram neat and like to sip it both neat and somewhat reduced.The initial mouthfeel is a little hot and peppery but nicely coating on all parts of my mouth. There is a minor astringent moment of cold metals (copper) which is another trademark PE characteristics. The finish is long and turns more to the bitter-peaty side with cold ashes, herbs, tea and tobacco leaves. Again it is a little astringent but this is not distracting in this context."

Slightly farmy with greasy leather notes and some honey.  Taste: Round and balanced with salty-tart herbs, rhubarb and grassy notes. Increasingly saline and citrus-tasting. This adds a peppery pungency to the finish, and the peat is better to advantage.  Finish: mid-length - apple and honey flavors emerge again. More and more smoky peat flavors are added and herbal notes, which work through dull in the background, but decay relatively quickly.

Maybe gets a little papery and spiritous as you drink more. Nice density here though and it is simply a good whisky. Very long into the finish. Slight seaweed.

6494,Port Ellen  9th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2009,"Always fun to try a whisky from a closed distillery and to start 2021 with a bang (hopefully), I chose this sample. A 30yo Port Ellen, should be a treat right?!This has a fresh, fruity and maritime start. Pears and apricots dominate next to salty maritime aromas and fine smokey aromas. Given the abv this doesn’t bite the nostrils. A citrusy and vanilla sweet continuation in the mouth where the salty, smokey and maritime notes become stronger. Nice oily mouthfeel and the alcohol is very well integrated. A nice long finish remains. Nice Port Ellen, but I have to be honest I’m not completely blown away and wouldn’t spend near €2k to buy a bottle of this stuff. A 30 yo Caol Ila does more or less the same and doesn’t hurt your wallet that much."

Orange, sherry, wood, honey and juicy mirabelle plums and apricots. In addition, a powerful salty flavor, which is underlaid with accents of lead, charcoal and old cardboard. But also peat, smoke and echoes of furniture polish - fresh - lively - great! Taste: Soft and very salty-spicy starting. The salt content is enormous and combines with hot chilli, paprika and coarse pepper. With additional notes of coal, wet ash, mighty peat, wood and a bit pulpy orange fruit, the result is a harmonious mouthfeel - great! Finish: Very long - absolutely clean and filled with delicious phenols. The peat board stays and the wet, dark coal notes fit perfectly.

6498,Port Ellen  9th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2009,"nose  Ocean! Salty, oily, maritime and slightly smoky. This is how a Port Ellen must smell to me. that is perfectly the typical profile with which I think I can recognize Port Ellen among many.  Rubber, glue, and more oily marine salt. The smoke is sweet, like a well-marinated suckling pig and fried bacon. The alcohol is also well integrated here according to the age and does not sting. But there is enough power here too. Meat glazed with honey from the charcoal grill. With hot, slightly bitter mustard.  A very special but simply great nose for me!  taste  Very round, soft, but also very powerful in the mouth. The taste changes again to this maritime aroma, which reminds me extremely of oysters. In addition, it is still oily and salty. For me, this is Port Ellen in top form. The smoke is now subtle in the background and I mainly just notice these extreme maritime notes, plus a little glue and wood oil. I almost forget the smoke. The whisky has a strong structure, it almost feels like I have something solid in my mouth, not a liquid. The sea and fish are omnipresent and make this dram so special. Also especially good for me.  Exit  The finish is long and pleasant. The aromas from the taste continue nicely, but there is a slight addition of white pepper that tickles the edge of the tongue. It remains extremely oily, salty and maritime. Here, too, the oysters are dominant. I only notice smoke because I know that it should be there. The longer the taste sticks in the mouth, the more there is somehow a taste of smoke from the charcoal grill. From my point of view, this departure should stay forever.  Conclusion  A whisky that is very special to me and of my own, I don't know anything like that, but I love it. This is a real character whisky, and I simply won't find these extreme maritime flavors anywhere else.  N-94, T-96, F-95 for also top-notch 95 points"

As it opens up it becomes sweeter and fruitier. The smoke also becomes more multidimensional with medicinal and camphory edges along with a scent from freshly cut forest wood burning by the fireplace. Notes of dried papaya, melon ice cream, green apples, Williams pears and sugared lemon sweets emerge. Grassy notes with wild chamomile and herbal oils are also added to this wonderful profile.Salty, herbal , resinous, tarry and quite dry. However this dryness is ultra velvet with a creamy and fatty texture. Vanilla ice cream with green olive's and agave's syrup infused with smoke. Quite grassy but perfectly balanced, never too dry or sour. A feeling of eating lobster soaked in an creamy smoky herbal sauce with agaves nectar.Very long with extra balanced waves of peat, lemons, resinous elements and grassy notes.

I loved the 9th release from last year as much as the 1st from 2001 (WF93) but the 21yo ‘Port Ellen Maltings’ still rules my list of official PEs (WF94). Colour: straw. Nose: oh this is restrained and elegant! Exactly the opposite of some exuberant peat monsters, this is very subtle, on old papers, almond milk, shellfish, old slightly musty spice mix, soot and quite a lot of cut apples. I think I’ll try to compare this one with the 22yo 1978 Rare Malts one day, I seem to remember that one was a true monster- exactly the opposite of this new 1978.                                               With water: the beast still roars! Water woke up a tarry peatiness that, precisely, reminds me of the Rare Malt (that I used to call ‘the Pirelli whisky’ – nothing to do with the naked girls on the calendars). Mouth (neat): ah yes, yes yes! More vibrant than the nose and ueber-lemony, superbly zingy, ‘chiselled’ and kippery. Greatest notes of olive oil and marzipan in the background. Gets then ashier and saltier at the same time. I don’t think we used to know how PE would behave after 30 years of age, I think we have the answer. With water: perfection made whisky. Please call the anti-maltoporn brigade. Finish: very long. Superb salty aftertaste and a contrasting spice blast (carvi, pepper, cloves, bitter almonds). Comments: wow. To think that we’ll have all these new old Port Ellens to try in the coming years! And if PE was the peaty Islayer that aged best? Shall we soon see the revenge of the old lady on her thundering neighbours? Imagine there’s probably much more old PE than old Ardbeg around… SGP:367 - 95 pointswhiskyfun.com"

Is it worth of 99points? In a word...No. I tasted this as objectively as possible obviously aware of Serge's review and its hefty 200gbp per pour price tag. This is one of the best Port Ellens I've tried but having said that Port Ellen can be so very overrated by less educated palates who are confused by Diageo's marketing and over-pricing and the fact that its a closed distillery and seen as very rare etc.. Anyway back to the Port Ellen. Quite a few extremely educated palates and well known whisky club owners tasted this along with me and we all concluded that Serge's review was somewhat subjective to say the least.

The Queen to Port Ellen Maltings,"February 4,  2015; Serge Valentin:Port Ellen 12 yo (OB, The Queen’s Visit to Port Ellen’s Maltings, 1980) One of, if not the most legendary Port Ellen, bottled in an Oban bottle when Queen Elizabeth II visited the maltings on August 9, 1980. No need to tell you how rare this is. Nobody seems to remember when it was distilled, but what’s sure is that it’s either 1967 or 1968. Or a vatting of both vintages, as the distillery was restarted in 1967. Are you following me? Colour: deep gold.      Nose: starts vegetal, with notes of turnips and beetroots, some leather, some other roots, some Barbour grease, some clay… Typical of an old bottle that was just opened, but we know the fruits will come out eventually. Transits through overripe apples, notes of cake… Before more acidic notes, soot, carbolic soap and garden bonfire arise. More sour fruits as well, mangos, passion fruits… It’s also more and more mineral, with some kind of sooty gravel, scoria, coal… What a whirlwind! Totally exceptional. Mouth: the label wouldn’t say, but it tastes like +/-45% vol. Starts compact, greatly sour and sooty. Unripe kiwis and cider apples on a very ashy background. Eating cigar ashes moistened with grapefruit and kiwi juice. Or something like that. Gains power over time, let’s just let this baby breathe for a few hours, as it was just opened. Zzzz zzz… After around eight hours (that’s right, 8 hours): full-blown passion fruits, utterly magnificent, with a light coal smoke, as well as mangos. Utter perfection. Finish: an astounding freshness, for a long time. It kills you. Nearly. Comments: the son of Michelangelo and John Coltrane. After having tried quite a few whiskies, I think – well, I know – that I will never find a dram that’s even better. Peace and love. And thank you caro Patrick. SGP:657 - 99 points."

While most Islays these days can best described as peat powerhouses that will bludgeon your senses with a peat cudgel, this one delivers the peat with deft of a master swordsman - immense yet contained with the malt ever present and a mineral-maritime complexity about it.

6558,Port Ellen 14th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2014,"Tasting Notes Courtesy of Diageo : Nose : Sophisticated and understated; dry overall, opening with distant, faint smoke, before a wave of familiar sweet and smoky notes, among which hints of hessian and warm wood are all that suggest great age. The distant smoke soon grows closer and more fragrant, while above it drift pleasing sweet aromas of honey-cured smoked meats or root vegetable. Through all this a fresh, cleansing note rises, to vie with sweet mint and sharp citrus - winey hints too. Finally, smooth, dark cocoa, some vanilla and more wood smoke. With water, first sweet, then more muted and savoury, though later a fruity clarity sweetly returns.Body : Smooth and agreeably oily.Palate : Immediate and lively! At first, rich and honeyed, the sweetness perfectly balanced by maritime salt as if to suggest sweet seaweed. Then, unexpected notes of citrus and ginger burst like lime and ginger marmalade on wholemeal toast. In turn, this sunny edge is clouded by sweet smoke, rising against a velvety backdrop of dark chocolate. The rich character remains in essence unchanged when reduced with water; still warming, the citrus becomes orange oil, with ginger and modest smoke.Finish : Very long and warming, with crisp ginger and citrus, and fresh, menthol-clean notes that rise against a backdrop of drying, oaky wood smoke.A glorious grande dame, superb in every way and with a poise and self-assurance born of long experience. An unexpected Port Ellen with a warming, spicy, gingery edge to its traditional sweet and smoky nature: captivating at cask strength, while a little water reveals a charming sweetness in the nose and richness and depth on the palate."

6564,Port Ellen 15th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2015,"N: This is a blend of 12 barrels, put in at 67% and bottled collectively at 53.9%. It's chatty with lots of peated chocolate on the nose, peppered ham, rancid, tropical fruit notes, buttered coal tar,  smoked ice-cream (is that a thing?) and heavy leather. In fact Colin Dunn coined this one ‘Port Ellen in a leather coat’.T: Fabulous arrival, salty, liquid peat, malty peat with all the oily, minerals, fruity, stone, flinty notes associated frequently with PE. Interestingly its almost identical to the Port Askaig 30 WB which preceded this tasting.F: Fruity, smoky peat,...... is that it! Again, the Port Askaig had an almost identical finish. It's a bit hollow, a bit too clean by PE standards…. but eventually, there's a little Port Ellen-ess at the end, but it's slight.C: Simply delicious stuff, but like the Brora, surprisingly undramtic or overly remarkable. The end of the end? How many barrels are left, barrels good enough to release as official bottlings? Maybe it's only the status and mystique of the rare releases that's keeping the circus touring?Scores a B[+] 88"

At first very fruity, with shells of red apples and fresh pears, which turns into a lush toffee note. You smell the beach - hot sand, sea air, seaweed and the ashes from the campfire - as the development increases.  Wonderfully honeyed with water; The toffee is wrapped in wood smoke and leads to a sweet pungency, with malty appeal.  Taste: Wonderful in natural cask strength of 53.9%. Sweet, sparkling and dry, with a great blend of wood ash, roasted marmalade tart, toffee and caramelized orange. Then increasingly penetrating smoke with a spicy herbal note and a hint of carnations.A little water makes it cooler and milder. Moderate in the body.  Resonance: Long, cooling and complex. Dry, yet enveloping. Immediately appetizing, with apple, roasted toast, lemon zest, ripe red apples and baked plum tartlets. Many herbal notes and heavy, with wood smoke that softens with water.

6578,Port Ellen 17th Release  Diageo Special Releases 2017,"A few nights ago I was looking for something special, and the bar's list narrowed it down to one of the last official releases, Brora 16th or Port Ellen 17th. I didn't have to think twice, since Diageo ended the Brora series with a whimper, but the Ellen ought to still be good as befits a final release. It's been a while since I've had an official Ellen anyway.Another day, another bottle might have earned a 93, but 92 is my verdict for now, the same as 7th release which this one does well remind me of. This is a fitting end to the series, and in my opinion almost a stereotypical old PE. The price is insane though. You'll never enjoy this whisky THAT much.Smoked white fish? Is this a Caol Ila? No, the vinegar-y thing I often find in PE is here, and chamois and pine needles, and soft old oak. This is a classic ex-bourbon '70s Islay that I could just nose forever. Pickle juice and leather aprons. Lemon zest, vanilla ice-cream, and something chemical.On entry an obvious 90+:er. It settles all over the tongue and takes hold. Wet chalk, citrus, salt, kelp, chamois, with some faint floral and tropical sides too. The peat feels heavy on my tongue, and there's also that medium dose of old dry oak I've come to expect of the Releases. Great composition, divine mouthfeel.Lasts longer than a Swans song. If only all finishes were like this. Lemon, leather, and salt linger. The taste changes slightly all the time, as does the nose too. An evolving spirit, just like the best should be."

The fantastic aroma of underground tunnel (I really like that, my wife hates it!), Old steam locomotive, damp cellar, plus barbecue sauce and perfectly integrated smoke. Oily, waxy, maritime, ultra harmonious and with perfectly integrated alcohol. That would be enough, but the malt develops in the glass, now switching to coconut, butter biscuits, fresh straw, roasted nuts, damp soil and foliage. After a short time different again, pear compote, the smell of a new and for the first time opened book and smoked ham, constantly changing aromas!  Mouth: Sweet, salty, voluminous, with actually exactly what I had previously perceived in the aroma, that's what's dancing on my tongue! You can not say much more about this, maybe even that the mouthfeel is wonderfully powerful and yet not obtrusive, with time maybe some licorice and tar.  Finish: Medium long, but with everything in the reverberation, which I had tasted before.  Conclusion: Great, even without apparent sherry barrel impact, a Port Ellen in best shape!  https://whiskycuse.wordpress.com/"

6598,Port Ellen 1978  Rare Malts Selection,"Straight JacketLet’s finish this line-up of Port Ellen samples with this official bottling from the famous Rare Malts Selection (the predecessor of the Diageo Special Releases). It has spent almost as much time in the bottle as it did in the cask. I sometimes see this bottle at auctions, but it will then set you back between 950 and 1500 EUR. Take your time for this one.Very complex nose on vanilla and almonds, joined by grapefruit, graphite, diesel oil, walnuts and the skin of Pink Lady apples. Then more citrus, candle wax, wet rocks, caramel and white fruit. Unexpected hint of mokatine and cold coffee. Becomes quite salty after a few minutes. Salted caramel, nougat, liquorice. Delicious.OMG! O-M-F-G! What a powerhouse. Sweet versus salt, but the salt is clearly stronger. Almost brackish, sturdy and feisty on tar and diesel, lemon and oyster sap, kippers and all of this is a straight jacket of smoke. Man, this makes me very, very happy.The finish is a grand continuation of the palate, lasts forever and fills me with a satisfaction beyond words.There is a god and it has been captured in this bottle!"

6601,Port Ellen 1978  Rare Malts Selection,"A great malt for sure, but not an extinct style, IMO. Really intense Port Ellen in its prime. Another take no prisoners Rare Malt. Really great in some ways, pretty rough on the finish.Lemon oils, brine, capers, oysters, sea shells, very clean nose on honey, brine and citrus. Lovely.Thick honey, pretty rough at full strength, a real brute. Waxy, hot cayenne, seashells, lemon and capers, peat builds - menthol, brisket, charcoal, billowing smokeBurnt plastic, iodine, heavy black smoke, bandaids, tiger balm. Really condensed and intense finish. A little too rough here."

Slightly smoky with spicy citrus, now there is even some honey."
6604,Port Ellen 1978  Rare Malts Selection,
6605,Port Ellen 1978  Rare Malts Selection,"Nose: The beginning is powerful, dry smoke, burning paper. Then the fruitiness of citrus is enhanced, followed by seafood and floral fragrance. The aroma began to become more moist. Ink, walnut oil, snake fruit, coconut wax, metal, almond cookies. The bottom of the cup has a salty smell, which can be found by just stuffing your nose in, and this smell is trying to use alchemy to sublimate all other flavors. Finally, this is a very complex bottle of whisky. For it, only the constant change is the same, and the balance is also perfect. Drink: The taste is oily and smooth, and the mouth is occupied by wonderful smoke, citrus, lemon, carbon, orange peel, dark chocolate, licorice, and many carbons, which secrete a lot of saliva. Overall: I keep wanting to add flavor descriptions to the fragrance column, but I find that I have written too much. But there are still fresh pineapple and dirty dog paws, don’t you write it?"

6607,Port Ellen 1979  Prima & Ultima,"Nose: Quite a nice one, starting on lovely wood then off to oil and leather, Not very surprising but it’s also coastal and a bit fruity as well, big on the wax, Parafine, old engine room notes, but fruity as well with banana peel, grapefruit. with time notes of olives, develop along with sweet smoke, seaweed, & brine. Like!Palate: Quite fierce and still packs a nice punch at 40 – with pepper upfront, then some more brine, tar, seaweed, toasted oak, soot, spent cigar and tea leaves, wax, cocoa powder, oak, more tarry ropes, FIMO (not FOMO).Finish : Distant smoke, spent cigar, tar ,kerosene and more wax.Conclusion: Yessir. This one’s an epic Port Ellen, and indeed in level with the Lagavulin from the P&U range, but so very different. Which one would I prefer? A tough question. Head to head, I’d go with the Lagavulin, but only by a very small margin. I am sure many others would disagree ????"
6608,Port Ellen 1979  9 Rogue Casks,"**We have a Winner!**In May last year, it tasted my best – but unfortunately also most expensive – Port Ellen ever. It was the 39 years old The Spirit Safe, bottled in 2018. This second edition in the Untold Stories – 9 Rogue Casks – is even more limited. There are only 1380 bottles in the world. It was presented during the (virtual) Feis Ile 2020 and is a vatting of 9 casks which were found to ‘hold unusual flavour characteristics that stood out from the typical Port Ellen distillery character’ and was deemed unsuitable fort he needs of the blenders at the time. For the anoraks among us, the vatting consists of these 9 ‘rogue casks’: 4 American hogsheads (#1469, #1680, #1747 en # 5176) and 5 European sherry butts (#4890, #4913, #4914, #6806 en #6816), all laid down in 1979. To put that somewhat in perspective for myself: I was 9 years at the time and had yet to see my all time favourite film – The Empire Strikes Back (1981). Just saying. Like her predecessor ‘The Spirit Safe’, she was bottled at cask strength, as luck would have it (?) at the exact same: 50.9%. The price is not the same though. This one has an RRP of 6.500 pounds or some 7.000 EUR. Oh, yes, I say ‘she’ and ‘her’, for this Port Ellen is an elegant lady in my book. A veritable diva. Rightfully so.Surprising delicate nose on bergamot, linseed oil, almonds and walnuts, lime zest, a cold firepit (the day after). Not neccesarily in that order. Each time I put my nose in the glass – for the occasion I had a 1920s Blender’s Glass on loan, and know now I have to get me a few – she offered something different, but always very pleasant. The peat smoke is there, but like a whisper. There is also a lovely, floral note. Orange blossoms. And even some peach, giving her some lovely sweetness. Very impressive.O.M.G. Wonderful! We have a winner! The first, careful sip immediately confirms that this Port Ellen is indeed somewhat atypical, but what a taste! This lady is not only very elegant, she is sexy to boot! Delicious notes of pink grapefruit with some pepper, soft oak, lemongrass, capers, cardamom, pipe tobacco and the peel of a lime. The peat is more outspoken than on the nose, creating a lovely smokiness, while still remaining delicate. Some eucalyptus offers a fresh lift. But everything is so delineated, tight, chiselled. In the lovely long finish I get hints of tea, lime juice, eucalyptus… incredibly good.I sat there sniffing the emply glass for another hour musing that I’d probably buy a bottle to actually drink if I could afford it. When I had my first sip, I actually cried out ‘We have a winner!’, hence the title of this little piece. She is simply a fantastic and absolutely intriguing malt, that effortlessly stumbled into my personal top 10. And to think there are plans for a third release in the Untold Stories to celebrate the reopening of the ditillery. Reckon I have enough time to get a second mortgage?"

6613,Port Ellen 1979  Casks of Distinction,I had an opportunity to taste it with my friend in London - and it is one of the best whiskies I have ever tasted. I bought one bottle to my collection :)
6614,Port Ellen 1979  Casks of Distinction,"Privileged to have tasted the oldest Port Ellen so far made and what a treat it was. Bottle Signed by George Crawford currently in charge of PE to revive the distillery.Nose: Surprisingly restrained unlike the usual PEs where you instantly detect the peat and smoke. Takes time to evolve and then you get the typical half burnt dry leaves, coal tar and medicinal notes. Hints of lemony notes with vanilla and some tropical ripened fruits much like guava...one can go on nosing this stuff.Palate: tropical fruits galore, sweet and syrupy, the smoke and peat return on palate. Do I get some perfumes? I am not sure...full bodied and it gives that satisfactory feeling of relishing a desert.Finish: typical smoky and peaty finish which is long.. long lasting. Classy dram...91 points."

6617,Port Ellen 39-year-old  Untold Stories,"DivineLet me start with the fact that this new Port Ellen will cost around 5.000 EUR, which is out of this world. You do get a fantastic packaging which is a metaphor for the spirit safe, which was first installed at Port Ellen. So you need two keys to get to the whisky, which is also a nod to the aforementioned apparatus. It is the oldest Port Ellen to date with its 39 years of maturation. Mind you, this is not a single cask, but a vatting of bourbon and refill sherry casks, bottled at a cask strength of 50.9%. Only 1.500 bottles worldwide are looking for a new owner with deep pockets. But is the whisky – which sounds and looks so legendary – also any good?Very lively and aromatic nose, in which the typical Port Ellen peat is very delicate and remains in the background, thus allowing all kinds of fruit to shine. Believe me, this is a complex fruit bomb on sultanas and mango, honey, tiger balm, melon, lime and mint. Surprisingly minty, in fact, making it seem much younger – which is to be seen as a compliment in this case.It is powerful on the palate, but very elegant at the same time. The peat smoke is now much more prominent and offers quite a bit of silt and smoke, while the fruit chooses lime as its leader. Midpalate it again becomes quite tropical and even a bit candy-like with coconut and Turkish Delight. But so very lively!The finish is deliciously long and represents a large part of the experience of this malt. It starts with sweet smoke and ends with a perfect little bitterness as if from a grape pith.Lively, elegant and complex. Those are the three keywords that linger in my brain. Add overpriced as a fourth, but that will not surprise anyone. It's a bit different than other PE’s I’ve tried, but that is most likely due to the fact that for this release only a limited number of casks was selected. I wish I could afford this, for it is truly sublime. In fact, it’s my 4th highest scoring whisky ever and the best Port Ellen ever for me (so far). Thank you, Arno – or more fitting: Honorable Mr Dobbels – for giving me this opportunity to taste!"

6627,Port Ellen Port Ellen Maltings  25th Anniversary 1973 - 1998,"We purchased a bottle from auction recently and have had the pleasure of tasting this on its own and in tastings against other heavy hitters such as 66/ Caol Ila, 75' Garioch, 58 Talisker, 74' Ardbeg etc. This is very good whisky. Lots of complex nuanced notes here but they take time to access because the cask was very active. The reason this doesn't get a 90 is for that lack of balance. The overriding vanilla notes from the cask leave this whisky unbalanced and mask some of the lovely barley notes. But still a very good whisky, just not worth the current asking prices. Edit - after 18months being open this bottle whisky has improved immensely. A lof of the bright cask notes have faded and while the whisky is still quite sweet overall we are bumping up our score to 90 as from 87 as far more depth has appeared."
6628,Port Ellen Port Ellen Maltings  25th Anniversary 1973 - 1998,"Peat, some barbecue, fruit, seasalt, oyster, zest and some pepper. Perfect balance."
6629,Port Ellen Port Ellen Maltings  25th Anniversary 1973 - 1998,"https://www.kaypingers-whiskyblog.de/frontend/fullarticle.php?id=450 Colour: Corn yellow Nose: Soft lemon, vanilla, a little honey, maritime and quite straightforward. Salty aromas of sea air paired with gray hints of coal. The proportion of peat is not very pronounced here, so there is a lot of leeway for lime, avocado and vanilla. Overall creamy round and without prominent tips! You have to give this malt a lot of time here, because then the nose gets better and better - a fine, creamy, creamy yoghurt with a phenolic touch and a suitable, slightly woody tartness - great! Taste: Wow, powerful, extremely spicy and very salty. What a board! Lime, lemon, peat, hot asphalt, tar, burning campfires, lots of smoke and sweet accents of creamy honey combined in excellent harmony. Getting drier and fresher towards the finish. Everything you need for an outstanding PE - ingenious! Finish: Very long - still spicy, salty-hot and maritime! Still straight and getting a little bit tart. Mineral notes, brook stones and soft herbs in a diluted coal-peat brew with penetrating vanilla. All in all - TOP! 94 points N: 93P / G: 95P / F: 94P"

6633,Port Ellen Port Ellen Maltings  25th Anniversary 1973 - 1998,"Despite being a legendary bottle released in 1999, it's almost impossible to find tasting notes of this anywhere. I'm happy to be the first to enter notes here. Drinking it next to Port Ellen 10th to mark the occasion. The nose has that creamy, tarry nuance that I find in good Port Ellen bottles, but it has an extra layer of intensity that's maritime and almost varnish-like. Big and burning. Mouth is sharp and chiseled with a massive amount of peat smoke, citrus rind, almost a mineral acidity. Develops with varnish and even numbs across the finish. Crazy! And really sharp flavors - ginger, cinnamon, horseradish. I think it's bigger and more interesting than the 10th, which is a splendid subtle whisky of its own. Adding a little water allows more nectarine, cream, and vanilla to come out. Palate is thick and juicy. Absurdly good, even better than the 10th."
6634,Rosebank 08-year-old  Single Malt,"sample from a friend                  OB from the 70sLight and fruity, and the floral notes one would expect, just well-defined and elegantly beautiful. This strikes me with the complementary layers - first, the light, sweet barley/malty quality. Close behind it is lemon zest in refined vanilla with some spring and summer flowers dropped in. Last, and with some time, red and sweet fruit emerges. Wild strawberries, raspberries, lingonberries, and maybe a peach as well. Really delightful.A little punchy, but not aggressive, very well balanced. Some honey notes, oak, vanilla, malt, the pith or more fleshy lemon. Very light smoke and an even smaller amount of coastal salt/sea-spray element.Not the longest lasting, and the red fruit quality comes out a little more from retrolfaction at the back of the throat. The palate and finish are nice and elegant, even if a smidge simpler than the nose. This is just beautiful stuff, and maybe benefits from some OBE. Really grand."

Very sweet on bourbon vanilla and manuka honey flavours complemented by a nice summer floral profile. Hints of salt too, very unusual in a Rosebank.Wow, the body offers a lot of layers and rolls in nice waves over your taste buds. Very complex and nicely balanced with all the floral, malty, wooden and spicy flavours. It is a little bit drying (cold ashes) but this is rather enjoyable as an additional impression.The arrival on the palate is sweet and peppery but despite the 60.3% abv not hot at all. The finish is of medium length and keeps this delicious profile. With water added the nose gets smoother and even more complex. As does the body, but the profile flattens somehow and a stronger camphory flavour pops up that spoils the perfect harmony. So be careful with water, some drops will do the job for the nose without harming the body."

Personally enter the Rosebank by relying on the 43% 12yo, which is the best among the little flowers and birds.

It needs and deserves to be experimented a bit with water.Dive in to quick and your nose hair will curl up.At 62,3% there's no doubt this is hot, but in a very clean and fresh way.Sweet lemon and green apples.A barn full of dry hay, with the dust tickling in the nose.Very pleasant and inviting.With a little time a light wood note emerge.Water brings out even more lemon and sweetness.Surprisingly light arrival with a waxy texture.Clean peppery spice develop along with light chocolate.Water mellows it down very nicely, but it retains the texture.The pepper eases off a bit and it becomes more nutmeg.Citric notes turn more towards pineapple.It coats, sticks and stays... long time.Neat it retains a pleasing peppery warmth accompanied by something reminding me of a very good olive oilWith water everything is toned down a bit, and for the finish it was actually more interesting without."
6684,Rosebank 1981  Rare Malts Selection,"I agree with maltmartin here. Needs time to unravel, but it’s very hot out of the gate. Lots of chili oil, red wine vinegar, hessian, ginger, white pepper and honey. Needs lots of time, but like other rare malts, is an assault of the senses.I like it, but I don’t love it. Certainly not for the prices it goes for now."
6685,Rosebank 1981  Rare Malts Selection,"We had to laugh right at the tasting, because all involved could confirm the late blow how this works? No idea. But exciting own notes and a nice mix of sweetness, pungency and minerals / salt is there, top part.Rises directly into the synapses, the power is clearly noticeable, banana, marzipan, coconut and a little smoked bacon, honeydew melon, apricot, physalis, cream, vanilla, light honey, chalk and salt, lemon ice cream and papayaComes first very pleasant, if full, all the fruits again with papaya, lemon, banana, honeydew melon, apricot, etc.  Then, after more than 10 seconds, an alcoholic punch suddenly comes into my face, like I have never had it so late and vigorous and explode all kinds of new notes, fennel, anise, ginger, wasabi, avocado paste, cardamom, tonka beans, white pepper, very crazy and something AsianBurning tea, eucalyptus, more oak now, some more anise, candied ginger, honeydew melon and some dry apricot, rose water, long to very long"

A lot of pepper spiciness, but also compact fruit wall, juicy pineapple and a little mango. Wonderful part. With water: more palatable, now also oily, spicier.

6702,Rosebank 1987 - Sample,"What an amazing chance to taste such a unique, one-off bottling. Its story is quite amazing too, more insight to be found on the web if you're curious ! Thanks to the one that let me taste one of the few remaining centilitres on earth - he'll recognize himself ;) 90-91[Blind tasting] Very expressive despite the low proof, this is superbly ""patiné"" - I still can't figure out how to mean that in English :'( - and a definite creamy theme to it. There's hot wax and maybe a touch of sunscreen balancing a sweet an innocent fruitiness with white peach, banana and Lipton yellow label. Magnificient softness. I couldn't guess its identity though - some markers could hint at Clynelish, yet I very much doubt it is one.The proof is borderline weakish but it's still very pleasurable, on the same theme, with soft and sweet delicate fruits, mostly banana, with this creamy-waxy character still very much present. Subtle.Slightly more herbaceous, not overly long (expectedly). After reveal, I'd say this part is probably showcasing more typical Lowlands DNA than the rest indeed."
6703,Rosebank 1990  Release One,"The king is dead, long live the king (of the Lowlands)!I think it is fair to say that Rosebank is in the top five of closed distilleries. This King of the Lowlands was shut down in 1993 and for the longest time it looked like it would never re-open. But then Ian MacLeod stepped in – which we know mostly from Glengoyne and Tamdhu – and announced in 2017 that they would bring Rosebank back. The renovations have started and in the run up to the reopening they will release some of the old stocks that were part of the deal in buying the name from Diageo. That it inself is quite exciting considering that they have only a few hundred casks left. This one matured for no less than 30 years and is aptly named Release One. It’s a vatting of refill sherry butts (62%) and refill bourbon hogsheads (38%), all put to sleep in 1990. Let’s sit down for a while with this one…The nose is very summery and fresh with lots of citrus fruit like lime and pomelo, but also nectarines and even a hint of papaya and grapefruit. But it doesn’t end there. I also get some Granny Smith, peach from a can and a soft note of freshly cut grass. But everything is so soft and elegant. Dorian Gray would have this in his cabinet, I’m sure…Ah, that first sip… oily, soft spices and even some woodsmoke, but again it’s all about elegance with nectarines, apples, citrus fruit by the bucket and some orange zest.Only in the finish do I get my first bitter note as if biting down on the pith of a grapefruit, but it only serves to provide perfect balance.Spirit-driven as we are used to from Rosebank, but this ons is very special indeed. The nose is just out of this world. The King is dead, long live the King! The price is hefty, sure. Between 1800 and 2400 EUR. But Bowmore or Highland Park of the same age are in the same price bracket, so I think it is a ‘fair’ price setting. And don’t forget: this is Rosebank, King of the Lowlands!"
6704,Rosebank 1990  Release One,"As elegant a nose as you'll probably ever encounter on a single malt, with a more vibrant and present palate. Great mixture between bourbon and sherry casks.Such a gentle, yet rich and lively malt. It's the vibrant citrus notes that stand out, with the loveliest of orange zest, but also some watermelon and notes of peach and nectarine. Finally some grapefruit. Then there's touches of sweet pastry, buttery Chardonnay and maybe even some charred oak in the background.Creamy, buttery, fruity and a gentle spiciness. Elegant fruits like nectarines, ripe apples and apricots but also candied almonds. Even a touch of smoke, although very much hidden and in the background.

6707,Rosebank 1990  Release One,"A beguiling, enticing, full-bodied single malt appealing to all senses in perfect balance. After three decades of maturation in oak casks, the intoxicating fruit aromas dominate here, which present themselves in harmonious unity with the spicy notes from the wood. The oak remains discreetly in the background. A perfectly matured single malt that has lost none of its freshness, tangyness and liveliness after so many years of aging. Only one question remains: Why was this distillery closed in 1993 at all? Thank God it is currently being brought back to life!I thank Ian Macleod Distillers for the complimentary sample! https://www.whisky-connaisseur.de/2020/10/22/rosebank-30yo-1990-vintage-release-one/Surprisingly lively, fresh and fruity on the nose with yellow fruits, ripe pears, light grapes and some mango. Later ripe apples and banana are added, accompanied by vanilla ice cream, honey and a subtle caramel sweetness. In the background a spice mix of nutmeg, ginger and white pepper is noticeable. Only a little oak wood for the 30 years of maturation.Unexpectedly powerful on the palate with a spicy warmth of nutmeg and white pepper. This is accompanied by sweet toffee, creamy vanilla and a lot of tropical fruits. Very well balanced with spicy oak and ginger aromas. In addition, a little bitter orange peel in the background. Silky smooth, creamy and spicy with a touch of nut towards the finish.The finish is long lasting and pleasantly warming with a floral note, some chamomile and mint. This is accompanied by slightly bitter orange notes and dry oak towards the end.With water: After adding a few drops of water very fruity and beguiling of tropical fruits, citrus fruits - limes and oranges. With creamy vanilla and oak in the background. Sweet and fruity on the palate with lively notes of orange lemonade. Accompanied by spicy aromas of oak, nutmeg, ginger and a touch of pepper. Creamy and slightly dry. The finish is still very long, slightly warming with notes of caramel, nutmeg, a hint of mint and drying oak."

6709,Rosebank 1990  Release One,"A long time ago since I’ve had such a beautiful dram and definitely one of the better whiskies I have tasted this year. A very good Rosebank, which with its thirty years of age delivers exactly what you want from such an old dram. It’s still very vibrant, nowhere too oaky, but full of flavour and an abundance of tropical fruits.Very vibrant and fruity, especially for its age. Really good! Bananas, nectarines and peaches. A sweet grapefruit, followed by sweet somewhat overripe pears and mango. Later also a pinch of honey and caramel fudge. A faint hint of charred oak as well.Again very fruity and quite elegant. Pears and sweet apples. But also nectarines. There is a lovely layer of creme brulee, giving it a creamy texture. Then it goes towards spices, leaving the creamy texture behind. White pepper, cinnamon and a touch of cloves. A little bit of toffee and a touch of charred oak again.Long with the same spices and somewhat oaky. Some fruits in the background."

6713,Rosebank 1990  Diageo Special Releases 2011,"On the nose, extremely floral and slight grassiness. Confectionaries also flow through from woody sweetness. Vanilla extract is also apparent. Perhaps a little bit of cereal in this as well. All in all, another undeniably elegant and well-balanced nose from Rosebank. On the palate, lemonade and vanilla stand out dominates the profile. Elderflower also comes forth and balances out the spiciness that may be the result of a triple distillation. Some fresh-made marmalade can also be detected. Unlike many lowlander, this Rosebank is not overwhelmed by its cask maturation.On the finish, medium to long with notes of citrus and pepper. Digestives also flow through towards the end.This is a much better Rosebank than the Flora and Fauna 12, but the 25yo Special Release stands to be the best recent Rosebank release."

6726,Rosebank 1992  Diageo Special Releases 2014,"Hard to pin down, really wasn't expecting that ! Its shyness will prevent it from being truly great in my opinion, but it confers this Rosebank an undeniable restrained classiness, with a clear old-school feeling and a beguilling complexity if you're patient. This somehow reminded me of the famous Clynelish BBR #6421, concept-wise.Quite oddly, the first notes I get are rather industrial, with strange oils and waxes, then maybe some undefined plant-based ointment. With patience and aeration, gets very complex. Very old floral pot-pourri but we're not talking heady flowers, rather little dry meadow flowers. Orange essence, with a light fizzy acidity. Meadow grasses, morphing later on into very complex and unexpected notes of Parma ham. Sure wasn't expecting that ! To me, there's almost nothing at the fruit department here, expect a little transient orange. But I shall not complain because its herbal-industrial restrained complexity is very interesting. Water doesn't change much.Very nice kick of these little meadow flowers indeed, meadow grasses. Great alcohol integration. We're soon back on these super peculiar industrial notes then, with a strange waxiness. Vegetal freshness, tea, very complex notes upon later sips that I can't seem to describe. Very interesting but again, rather restrained and austere.Quite short actually. Quite milky and malty, clean, with white tea, dried cut grass."

There is a slight sweetness, which comes from the cereal, but also from the fruit, where everything mixes perfectly. Lemon financier, juicy Golden apple, light pineapple. Light white flower, elderflower.On the palate, the attack is more floral than on the nose, while retaining this beautiful sweetness to avoid making these disgusting notes. Rose, elderflower, lilac. Then the fruit takes over, with pineapple, lemon zest, pear. The barley then arrives, comforting, with a little fresh almond, corn flakes, butter.The finish is long, buttery, on the lemon financier, varnished wood, white pepper, and a light herbaceous peat.

Good modern sherry cask, some spice, altogether more craftsmen-like than the rather lackluster first range. I hope they continue this new philosophy and it does not become a one-trick-pony. Would love to see a 15 +18 yo version of this juice. :-) Good bang for the buck atm. Recommended."

6757,Royal Brackla 12-year-old,"I was immediately attracted to the wonderful color. I hadn't tried Royal Brackla before and I wanted to try it out. The price is still okay with the key data. I am pleased that distilleries like this one seem to be more responsive to the wishes of their customers: dispensing with cold filtration and coloring, as well as bottling with increased alcohol content.My advice: A whisky, especially when it has been reopened, needs enough time in the glass to develop its aromas. This is particularly the case here. Rather closed at the beginning. Then berry-fruity, spicy and pleasantly oak-tinged aromas unfold. You can clearly see the Oloroso barrel. Very nice.What the nose promises continues in the taste. A slightly sour (berry) fruity sherry-dominant highland malt is not too sweet with a pleasant oak spice. The berries go towards blackberries or currants. Notes of a beautiful red and gold apple can also be tasted. There are also traces of nuttiness. Think of almonds. With increasing time in the glass, a beautiful malt with a fairly diverse spectrum unfolds on the palate. The alcohol does not sting or sting. At 12 years old, he already seems very mature to me.Nothing burns here. It is soft in the finish. What remains is a sherry-heavy, pleasant impression. The sherry wood is also perceived very positively in the sense of an oak spice. There is some chocolateiness. Overall, the finish is medium-long."

6759,Royal Brackla 12-year-old,"After this revision, it showed quite good performance. In [12 years] & [Sherry] this level should be in the leading position. Royal brackla is very round, with honey sweetness in addition to Oloroso sherry, with a light body, creating a very balanced and harmonious expression in the mouth. Excellent work, I would buy a whole bottle. The sum of the taste is 86 points and the price +1 point for a total of 87 points.In addition to the dried fruit, caramel, oak, and vanilla that are usually found in Oloroso, there is a honey-like sweetness. Isn't this the patent of bourbon barrels? Overall it gives a very refreshing feeling.Although it says 12yo, the whole is very round, and the tongue hardly feels any irritation. Maybe the content contains more high-vintage malt? The aroma felt by the nose is all present, although it is 46% ABV, but because the body is very light, it does not have the heavy feeling of ordinary sherry barrel type whisky, but a just right sweet taste and refreshing feeling.Mainly honey, others are the common dried fruit, vanilla and other flavors of sherry, which last for a long time. quite comfortable feeling."

Nose: wait, now we’re talking. Oils and herbal teas, always great signs. Mashed potatoes with borage flowers – cool! – plus shortbread and lime tree blossom. Sounds unlikely, it is not. After that, some artisan butter and a few ultra-fresh walnuts without their skins. It’s a very subtle nose, requiring a little concentration, but it’s totally worth it. Hints of old-style mead, made by good sisters. Mouth: absolutely excellent. IPA (say Lagunitas – I’ve heard Heineken bought them, is that true?) plus fudge and caramel, with a subtle oily/herbal combination in the background. White asparagus, olive oil, a little marzipan just like in the 12, one bergamot, and a spoonful of genuine Swiss muesli. Plus a little candy sugar and custard to keep it rounded and mellow. Finish: medium, not short. Orange cake this time, and big time. Sponge finger cakes. Comments: I think I’ll have to put my gun back into the holster, these babies work at 40% vol.

I actually liked this one more than the whiskybase average and it was one of my favourites out of 9 mediocre, but totally inoffensive scapas. I just wish scapa had the balls to bottle something over 40%. Because scapa needs and deserves more. It’s really good, but it’s not unlike Blair Athol or Glentauchers in the sense that a lot ends up in blends, so they aim for a fairly tame and generic profile. Which is fine, but it won’t showcase well at 40%. Come on scapa, grow a pair.Dainty, fruit salad, Manuka honey, a little pine sap, bubblegum, light beeswax, a few citrus notes. I like this nose, but its very light.Loses steam, but after chewing for a few seconds it builds a little.

6797,Scapa Skiren  The Orcadian,"Orkney's second distillery is often overlooked for a reason: its small range of NAS expressions is poorly presented and shockingly expensive! Matured in first fill American oak, the nose of Scapa Skiren is gentle, creamy and citrusy with notes of pine needles, barley sugar and heather honey. Did you ever taste the Christmas tree? Resin and wood bitter flavors attack the palate with a dry kick, disrupted by hints of sweetness and Ricola cough drops. More bitterness, lemongrass and Earl Grey tea dominate the rather short finish. Back to Highland Park...RATING: 3.0/5.0 stars ≙ 79 pts → AVERAGE"

Additionally Im reviewing the last few drams of that bottle, which were drunk today in an effort to secure more shelf space. Not a great whisky, and the price seems extravagant for what you get, but if you can pick up a bottle for cheap its a good daily sipper or introductory single malt.Nutty, malty, wet cardboard, with a whiff of flowers and honey.Mildly fruity on barely ripe apples and pears, yeasty bread, not quite done baking.

While it helps making this whisky quite peculiar, it seems not so relevant for the taste, so it easily turns out as a non necessary element. Anyway, the Port casks give this one a quite distinctive character, starting with the liquorice and malty nose, which can even remind a Belgian beer, bitter and rounded at the same time. On the palate, it's quite interesting, with dark chocolate, cappuccino and mellow red fruits well mixed together. The profile is still not very complex, yet the weirdness it leaves in the mouth and in its medium length aftertaste make it something much original, yet easy enjoyable.In conclusion, leaving the exteriority aside, it's not only a distinctive whisky, but also a well crafted and a richly balanced one. Worth trying (again) for sure."
6821,Beinn Dubh The Black,I don`t get the bad reviews. It is certainly not a top class whisky and agree with Marko_I that it was likely a young wet port barrel that might have contributed to much of the taste as well as the color. However I like the bitter note that certainly reflects bitter chocolate. Additionally a higher AVB would have been beneficial.

It smells as sweet and powerful and crisp as the color announces. This is nice, a bit thin in the beginning but the aftertaste is sublime. Not at all sweet but almost salty, with an edge of resin, unbelievably dry. Above my cap, I give him reluctant 88 points. It is probably better than that and not spent on my Neanderthal tongue."

Going further, the port influence lends a medicinal/fruity cough sweet suggestion, offering a strong illusion of this being [part] actual bourbon. However, time allows the maltiness to come through and these suggestions disappear. Now settled, this is malty fusty single malt whisky with some good age behind it.T: Seemingly bold with a rather short/sharp cutting middle/muddle, this seems like right old hangover juice. The tawny influence, whilst providing sugar-sweetness, offers less top notes than the Tenne, the resinous bourbon base ploughing on regardless.F: Some side cheek & top-palate heat builds up from a fairly consistent and true-to-form direction, finishing as if the bottom fell out. Where did it go? I may find out in the morning!C: Great single malt for bourbon drinkers [and grain fans] perhaps, though at €60, this 12yo has some serious competition."

6857,SPEY 18-year-old  Selected Edition,"So, what is my conclusion? Somehow that was nothing ... This was the first sample from the advent calendar which did not quite promise me. Although this blindsample is not quite as bad as it seems, this indefinable aroma disturbs my taste. I liked the nose the most. ""The nose looks quite young and yet very versatile, fruity, grassy and flowery."" exactly this statement in my notes fully applies. I suppose I had a very young ""non-Scot"" in the glass today, and I'd like to have a better lesson. In a nutshell: OK and 81 points ...Blind tasting: While the blind sample shines bright amber in the glass, the drops dissolving out of the glass wall run back into the glass relatively quickly ... I'm curious what the nose says. Dark caramel mixes at the beginning of Nosing with sweet tart fruits, a subtle Röstaromanoten lies discreetly in the air, now dissolve fruity orange flavors from the initially quite closed nose. The nose becomes noticeably fruity and sweeter by the minute, green apples and pears mix with apricots and restrained cherries. Floral hints, sweet vanilla and a grassy note mix to a flower meadow with orchards. The nose looks quite young and yet very versatile, fruity, grassy and flowery.The first sip looks rather dry and dry compared to the fruity and sweet nose. Spicy woody elements and an indefinable tart fruit-sweetness blend get sharper and tart after a few moments. A touch of furniture polish and wood stain followed by dry and dry wood tones, the fruity note lies discreetly in the background, walnuts and indefinable spice merge. A touch of cognac is created, the glaze and polish flavors return. Tart and with a hint of dried fruit and berries, the taste passes into the finish.Tart and spicy wood tones are on the tongue. Again, this indefinable spicy note comes to the fore, harsh, wooden and nutty the finish sounds slow and leaves behind this funny and indefinable aroma on the palate and on the tongue."
6858,SPEY 18-year-old  Selected Edition,"Hm, it's OK. He gets 80 points. But he does not tear me away from the stool either.  - Notes from an online chat comparison of the entire Spey range.Spice again, but more restrained, with sherry fruits. This time I also have some soap. Oranges and chocolate, now wild berries.Chocolate, honey, again this weak alcoholism, by the 18 years but civilized. Too little oak influence.The alcohol drowns something here, then come chocolate notes and yet a little oak. Overall again quite fleeting."
6859,SPEY 18-year-old  Selected Edition,"I hardly know Spey. Not actually. This Tenne turns 18YO and the first notable observation is that he smells peated. Not an exaggeration, not a hardcore Islay campfire-in-your-mouth, but still, something called Spey and so emphatically smoky is remarkable to say the least.  A piece of Chaumes cheese precedes this one. That's a not so prevalent ""full and soft"" French cow cheese. Tired of character, that cheese - but the whisky wins.  Under these war conditions, the Spey has to work. And he doesn't have to be ashamed of anything. The fragrance remains, the taste is beautiful, full and complex. The peat stays upright without dominating; there is a nice sweet note of honey and light fruit - there is even a hint of white wine, but that can come from the combination with the cheese. A powerful, confident and varied, impressive dram."

6870,SPEY 1990  Single Cask,"PeanutSince the last takeover of this distillery – by Harvey’s in 2013 – the name of the whisky was changed from the rather pompous and confusing Speyside to simply Spey. This is quite a young distillery, in fact. George Christie started building it in 1962 (ten years after he had built the North of Scotland grain distillery, by the way), but it took until 1987 before she was ready. Then another three years – 1990 – until the first spirit trickled from the stills. This is an important tidbit in this case, as I am about to try a single cask from that very first year, released in only 250 bottles by the new owners in 2016.The nose is very nutty. Think hazelnuts, almonds and even salted peanuts. Some nougat. Vanilla and barley sugar take care of the sweetness, but I would not call this fruity. Some pear, maybe? There is a sour note that I do not like. Soft spices. All in all a very light and innocent nose, much younger than the quarter century maturation merits.It starts very sweet and spicy (pepper, nutmeg, liquorice), almost piquant on the palate, but then suddenly a huge bitterness kicks in. I cannot help but think this was a very tired cask, but this malt is clearly spirit-driven. Not much going on here.The finish is bittersweet, with the emphasis on bitter. Pity.I understand the new owner’s urge to release a cask from the early days, from a nostalgic point of view. But this is not very good and thus not worthy of its high price tag. Thanks for the sample, Tom."
6871,SPEY 1990  Single Cask,"A quite powerful nose with lots of marzipan, sweet nuts, quite spicy actually. There's quite some maltiness on the nose as well, notes of a Belgian fruit beer.A quite spicy even hot start. Lots of spices and even a hint of hard spanish nougat. There's quite some bitterness in this one as well. I suspected something a lot sweeter ... not sure I'm liking this bitterness.The finish is rather short and bitter ... a bit of a dissapointment to be honest"

Finally, there is a little bit of mon cheri and PIMMs  too.Rather hot and spicy without water, but in a nice way! It's a tad savoury, certainly with a nice acidic touch, and medium sweet. Think of various red fruits, Dutch appelstroop (treacle), dates, christmas cake, orange, and even mint. With water: more balance, a bit of sulphur now, but pleasant. Yet, the hot feeling is mellowed down, the spices are softer. The finish is long, but quite hot, and dry on the cheeks (that's without water).

I thank Caminneci - Wine & Spirit Partner for the sample!https://www.facebook.com/Whisky-Connaisseur-550443305109776/Sweet and fruity on the nose. Ripe peaches, mixed with dried apricots and overripe oranges. Subtle malty flavours emerge with breakfast cereals, a whiff of vanilla, slightly floral and waxy notes. Very appealing!The sherry is more prevalent on the palate. Sweet with sticky fruity flavours of ripe peaches, apricots and mango. This is immediately followed by a warming load of delicate spices - oak, ginger, cinnamon and white pepper. A touch of slightly bitter walnut flavours arrives with subtle earthy and spicy notes towards the finish.The finish is medium long and sweet with apricot jam and stewed apples. Becomes dry and slightly bitter on the tail with oak and walnuts.WITH WATER: Water significantly tames the delicate fruitiness on the nose which releases only a whiff of vanilla and malty flavours.

6902,SPEY Chairman's Choice,"A decent whisky, but not able to develop any real complexity. He lacks emphasis on his tongue and finish. Nevertheless, overall tasty and beautifully opened. Priced from my point of view but then a lot overdrawn.Light, fruity, floral and sweet. Vanilla, caramel, overripe oranges and malt sweets. Later, a colorful flower meadow and a bit of hay appear. In the distance a little cinnamon can be seen.In contrast to the nose here now much darker. Many mixed nuts, including the distinct bitterness of walnut shells. An earthy spice covers the tongue. Overall, a slightly thin mouthfeel remains, this whisky lacks strength. Here comes this neither from the alcohol content, nor from intensive barrels.Creamy and soft with vanilla pudding and delicate fruitiness of ripe apples, apricots and oak. Unfortunately, the spice tends to bitterness after a few moments."

Vanilla and caramel are loud. Some breakfast cereals and driedapricots. Not bad, but not earth shattering either.The body is okay. Not too light,luckily (I was a bit worried because of the low strength). Now the sherry isprevalent with dried fruit in the shape of apricots and peach, but also somespices like nutmeg, cloves and even some cinnamon.

With a few drops of water you push the smokiness to the background and the fruity you pull more forward. Think of yellow fruit such as a fresh pineapple."

This was likened to Balvenie’s Peat Week with regards to the production of Speyside’s peated malt that occurs just before the distillery’s ‘close & clean’ programme at Christmas.N: Aromatic phenolics over abundant barley spirit, how peat brings out that maltiness is a wonder. Those phenols, those oils, the saltiness, the brine, the ‘slick’,.. and yet light youthful playfulness remains.T: An accomplished arrival [from a malt that could be from a plethora of distilleries], that soon falls away, similar to its non-peated siblings that proceeded it.F: Peppery and spirity once again, though with a more tempered smoky and chalky-resinous-oily-dry finish.C: Me wonders how submarine captain George Christie’s vision of his distillery’s output differed from the current owner’s, and what direction the distillery and its spirit would have taken if he’d remained at the helm?"

6916,SPEY Fūmāre   Cask Strength - Limited Edition,Tasted on 04-30-2021 at Digital Spirit of Speyside Festival. The fruiteeness and the smoke don't harmonize for me.
6917,SPEY Fūmāre  Limited Release,"SmokeThe Speyside Distillery is something of an unknown. Most of the production goes into blends in Asia. Apart from that they also produced Beinn Dhu, Black Burn, Cu Dubh, Drumguish and Glentromie whisky as well as the Speyside single malt. That was recently rechristened to simply Spey and appears to be very popular in Taiwan. Today I will the Spey Fumare, which means smoky. As far as I am aware, this is the first and only official release of the peated version of this light Speysider.The nose is a pleasant surprise. White fruit (apples, pears), some grapefruit, hazelnuts and marzipan, wrapped in a mildly smoky blanket. There is also a mild sour note that I am not that fond off, but all in all this is a good nose. It is somewhat creamy upon arrival, immediately nicely sweet on honey and vanilla with again the white fruit – grapefruit takes the lead – and then allows for a big development of smoke that reminds me somewhat of Ledaig or even Caol Ila! Soft ginger and a bit of white pepper show themselves with the second sip.Some nutmeg appears in the finish and the peat does what it can to linger pretty long. A medicinal and very salty note lead this to its final resting place.Darn, whodathunk? This peated Spey is simply good."
6918,SPEY Fūmāre  Limited Release,"A bit short despite a nice balance between peat and spices.Apple pie, vanilla, exotic fruits, peatSlightly smoky, pineapple and pear, orange blossom and a little spice.Quite short, note of vanilla, apples and pear, a little earthy"
6919,SPEY Fūmāre  Limited Release,"Fumare, 46% alc. Original bottling Region: Speyside, Scotland Nose: sweetly elegant, if a little thin. The peat smoke rises in the nose, as well as light citrus aromas, vanilla and white chocolate. Next to it a whiff of cream. In the foreground, however, is the smoke, which is reminiscent of a campfire made of damp hardwood. Palate: Silky and gentle in the mouth, here too the peat smoke comes first. With cream caramel, light herbal aromas and a little celery. Finish: Medium-long and salty dry, the elegance has been lost. There is also quite a bit of malt. Conclusion: Not a bad whisky, but definitely bottled too young. 82/100 points (tasted in 2016) www.notesofmalt.com"
6920,SPEY Fūmāre  Limited Release,"Spey Fumare 46%. Very pale yellow. Aroma is very sniffable, custard over banana, some pale wood, cleanly distilled and nicely matured, maybe a touch simple but it's very pleasant. Taste is as clean as water up front, rising peat, unique character, absolutely crystal, the drinkability is really akin to water, it's so soft up front, so soft, then a little salt rises up with faint smoke, light oak character. In terms of the cleanness of the distilling all I can say is 'wow'. I don't know if I've ever had a malt this soft. Not even Brackla produces spirit this clean. Faint lemon comes through. The lightness and refinement is outstanding but the complexity and body might be lacking. For me, this is impressive. I mean I'm always going to favour the complex rich stuff but sometimes there's a little bit of magic in restraint and poise too. 3.7/88"

On the nose opening up very nicely after a while on smoked tangerines and pineapple, a nice silky mouthfeel with wormwood, peat and sweet barley and a medium finish with honey, peat smoke and vanilla. Clean spirit, good bourbon casks and peat contributed to this enjoyable malt (my first Spey as others didn't seem to be serious enough efforts for my taste), and the fine presentation without colour and chillfiltration makes this a very nice and recommendable surprise."

Phew, so it wasn’t water in my glass! Very light smoke, it is rather on something maritime and iodized. A touch of fresh herbs.Peat! Bis repetita (hey, they were the first using Latin). Some light smoke, as for the nose, a woody touch and maybe a little lemony tip. And… Nothing else unfortunately. Really nothing else… So sad.Peat! For a while… As used with peat… Still nothing else."

6928,SPEY Royal Choice,"Nose: quite settled and dry, already some dried grass, overripe brown apples, fresh grain, a hint of sherry and a lot of oak (spicy notes with some pepper and cinnamon). But somehow it looks pretty thin.  Taste: ah there is the strong malt note again, now no more fruits for it a lot of chocolate and caramel, a little spicy oak which is stronger in the finish and harmonizes nicely with the chocolate flavor. The remains long in the mouth but offers little more than the 12er.  Not a bad malt but in relation to the presentation and the price just a joke!"
6929,SPEY Royal Choice,this is not a good whisky
6930,SPEY Royal Choice,"https://whiskylovingpianist.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/spotlight-on-speyside-distillery-2020/Originally a limited edition whisky, this is regarded as Speyside’s ‘flagship’ malt. By far the most costly malt in their range, it consists of some of the oldest casks in their warehouse, back when the distillery officially opened in 1990 [and when sherry transport casks were still available]. Some of these casks are coming to fruition now.N: [Old, stored/hard] biscuit-based cake decoration sweetness, sweet [almond flake] nuttiness, sweet larder fustiness,,… there’s certainly plenty of [refill] bourbon-aged juice in here. Given time, the shoe polish, fertiliser notes, tomato leaves and > home-dug potato notes appear as true indicators of underlying age.T: Almost hesitant in comparison to the 12yo. Even though the abv strength is the same, this feels far more gentile with a delicate mouthfeel and a ‘naturally’ subtle saltiness. Nothing much happens, journey-wise, but it’s a pleasant if short experience.F: Oily  snackage, slightly coppery, oily barley juice to the end. Concludes rather malty-chalky-woody-dry with more of those cake/biscuit decoration sweets thrown in for good measure.C: Given the timing and time in space – i.e. a whisky boom and the Speyside distillery’s relatively short history – one has to assume this is some of the best juice the Speyside Distillery has to offer. It’s certainly good whisky, just rather uneventful at £145."

6936,SPEY Royal Choice,"I also think that the price of this whisky is absolutely not justified. From me he gets 79 points and is on par with the 12, which came over much more harmonious.  What I remember most clearly from the Spey Range is the nose of the Tenné. There was nothing of it from the rest. Too bad, but they still have a lot to do there. Maybe you should start with ""bake small rolls"".  - Notes from an online chat comparison of the entire Spey rangeAgain kräutrige flower meadow. Some fruit juice, the alcohol tinkers something, fermented apple, and:  ...Soap!  Overall, the nose is the most harmonious, but the Tenné she does not come close.So chocolaty I think that already. Herb chocolate, so to speak. But again the disturbing alcohol. I do not have soap in the taste, but something bothers me here. The notes just do not match.In the finish, he is actually a little woody, after the chocolate note has diluted over some honey. Still not very long."
6937,SPEY Royal Choice,"Non-starter. After all, I'm not a fan of using words like ""impudence"" in a matter of taste like whisky, but to put that in this luxury class, to ask for over 150 € and call him ""Royal Choice"", is a joke. In the equipment a nice gift for € 60.70, but the culmination of the range - never!Note: Now it's time for Tenné / 12 / Chairman's / 18 - quasi the ""royal graduation"" - one hopes.  sweet, grainy, honey, toffee .. search, search ... remains mild, unspectacular ... about nut, vanilla, a hint of cinnamon, the ""Royal"" stays outCreamy, caramel, vanilla, honey ... some oak, but no ripe, full, chocolatey notes - rather young, woody bitterness, even a little bit of piquancy ... well, the third, fourth sip, there is still some chocolate around, but the Sharpness remainsmedium length, caramel, a touch of chocolate, a little woody sharpness"

6943,SPEY Tenné  Selected Edition,"Spey Tenne 46%. Consumed Oct 2020. There's an interesting hue to this. Might just be the glass but it's generally a slightly red-hued amber. Aroma is raspberry milkshake, pink mice sweets, soft vanilla, plasticine. For me a bit too cask-led. Taste is warming and rich with a lovely weight. I mean the Spey spirit is great. The cask leads too much but it's juicy delicate, dried raspberries, warm, slightly cognac-like. Lingering red wine acidity. Blind I may not even have it down as a whisky. Beautiful weight. There's so much to like about the spirit and yet WHY THIS CASK FINISH? Okay, at least it's not red wine. Port sometimes works with bigger, peated spirits. But it just clashes and ruins this one. Increasingly I see Spey as up there with my favourite distilleries - the quality of their spirit is great. I think this cask choice is just not playing to its strengths though. I'm not in love with this dram but I'm growing in love with the distillery. 3.4/81"
6944,SPEY Tenné  Selected Edition,"Over all i rate this one one 7,4 out of 10 as a balance between the taste & the price. On the nose it's quit sweet, even a little too much for my taste. My first associatyion was raspberry sweets. Through the sweetness comes fruitiness, like the smells that came from fresh made jam/marmelade. While nosing the alcohol came trough in a strong way , until i added a drop of water. For the taste it did the same thing: more balance. Tasting: there's a little bite of alcohol at first but the fruitiness takes over soon. The sweetness is also there but less than i expected. To me that's a plus. It's raspberry and jam again. Some metallic hints arrive, some dryness and light bitters and before the finish someting tickled my throat that made me think of menthol or even a very light smokiness.The finish is short, with some dryness that can come from wood or nuts. This is an easy drinkable whisky, some fine fruitiness, maybe a little too much alcohol. But you can balance that with a drop of water or you can let it breathe for some time before you'll enjoy it!"

As a batch of 18000 bottles, that’s a serious commitment to a finish.Tasting note by Charles MacLean: ‘Copper / rose wine appearance, with notes of faint raspberry jam and rose wine, pot-pourri and pale fruits on the nose. Light in texture, sweet & faintly fruity, before drying slightly, leaving a trace of almonds in the finish. A light aroma & taste, very easy to drink. A quaffing malt‘N: Charles’s notes are, typically, resplendent. Without repeating or stepping on his shoes – though in total agreement – we’ve a pleasing light-fruity-jammy and floral potpourri nose with a dry hessian and coppery note. This is young chatty whisky, much like the Trutina to come.T: Fruity floral coppery and lightly malty, the tawny influence takes over the baton where the underlying spirit may well have already run its course.F: Pleasingly, it doesn’t come across as overly engineered. Remaining fruity and coppery [with a chocolate-y liqueur-like touch], it’s slightly more malty savoury > bitter by the tail.C: The ‘Hebes’ of whisky, on the nose at least, this works well enough overall. With 18000 bottles, and currently at around €30, it’s a whisky that’s going to be available to try and enjoyed."

6961,SPEY Trutinā  Cask Strength - Limited Edition,"A recommendation from the owner of a whisky store. Never had a Spey bottling before but since i'm all about the bourbon cask whiskies at the moment this seemed like a nice adventure.The ratings don't do it justice. This is a decent malt with a subtle combination between the spirit and the cask.The nose is elegant and fresh. Fresh fruits, mostly apple with a slight hint of banana. The fruits morph into fresh grass and a slightly fresh herbal note. I often find this really fresh note in speyside bourbon cask whiskies and i like it. The grass turns into hay with some time and the sweetness becomes more malt/breakfast cereal/vanilla like.The taste is far less interesting than the nose. The spirit dominates the cask which is what some whisky drinkers like. My ""unicorn whisky"" on the other hand combines the spirit and the cask and together they achieve higher levels. This Spey bottling doesn't reach that level. A tiny vanilla note hides behind the creamy cereal notes and a slight flowery accent never comes to fruition because it's buried by the cereal.All in all decent spirit driven taste but a couple of more years in the cask might help this reach higher levels and ratingsThe finish starts off with some sweetness which becomes hot and peppery and slightly woody and dry. It stays with you for a while but this is mostly due to the high abv."

The original batch of Trutina was 100% bourbon cask-aged for eight years and saw a 6-8 month finish. For batch 2, between 6- 8 years of age is typical.N: Fresh, robust-yet-relaxed, young light floral & [orange-y] fruity barley spirit. Less bourbon-like than the 12yo, yet also less fruity, this smells of [very] young, new-age spirit~whisky all the way.T: Immediately very raisiny,… then towards coppery tempered new make-y maltiness. The raisin vibes settle down a little though the driving resinous cask activity along with formidable lively-yet-focused spirit keeps the momentum up. This needs water no end. Diluted, however, same same, only slightly improved form and profile.F&C: Very peppery on the turn with more coppery raisins. Wow, that heat!! Add water to counteract, but why bottle at 59.1%?"

I think it’s quite interesting. The term Speyside may remind you of the production area for the first time, but in fact it is a winery located in the southern part of Speyside. The distiller used was dismantled from [lochside]. There is only one pair. The roof of the house was worn during installation. After that, their production process was very easy, everything was slow, fermentation was slow, and distillation was slow. Only a few hundred thousand liters are produced each year, and [Drumguish-Drumsticks] is the first single malt whisky series produced by this distillery. Now their whisky is called [Spey], and [Drumguish] was in oak The barrels were matured for three years before being reconciled and bottled and released. However, due to various reasons, [Drumsticks] were all sealed up a few years after being listed. The batch of [Drumsticks] I drank is probably from Mongolia. If the bottle is sealed for too long, there is a risk of the bottle being broken. From another perspective, it is undoubtedly real wine."

You could also describe the nose as an apple and cinnamon cake. Toffee notes, light acidity and logging are available.Light mouthfeel, which is more due to the low alcohol content. Much spicier than the nose. Various spices combine with ripe fruits to a great taste experience. Wood flavors, toffee, a little honey and vanilla complete this bottling.Short - medium long and spicy."
6994,Speyside Distillery 12-year-old,"Tasting Note by The Chaps at Master of Malt                The nose is of medium-body with a superb balance. There are notes of peppermint, cut herbs and cereal sugars with juicy barley. The palate is medium-bodied with notes of barley and cereals, some cut herbs and a menthol note with developing oak. The finish is of good length with a touch of warmth."
6995,Speyside Distillery 12-year-old,"Nose:- Whiff of soft weedy peat open up in the glass, causing light heat and pungent to the nose. Sniff it softly and discover some goodies beneath it, oily hazelnut and touch of pine, follow by hints of chinese herbal oil. Palate:- Tinge of decay note upfront, quite weedy. Soft and non spicy, hence allowed to hold the liquid longer on the palate. Effortlessly let it drift from weedy and restrained sweetness to toasted seasoned wood with hints of vanilla. Delicate dram and patient is essential on appreciating this dram.  Finish:- Smooth and warm ripe fruits and honey carry on, simple and short. — at The Whisky Bar, Kuala Lumpur."

7007,Hazelburn 10-year-old,"The nose was young, but not disturbingly so. On the palate and finish, this is simply marvelous. But unpeated? I think not.Sturdy, creamy nose on breakfast cereals, white fruit, paraffin, frying oil, litchi from a can and vanilla. Underlying you’ll detect the typical characteristics that you also find in Springbank such as chalk, jute and ship’s rope. Soft and inviting, though clearly young.On the palate, I immediately think of Springbank as well, but without the peat (note to self: doh!). Very creamy, spicy, waxy on paraffin, lime, chalk, (a lot of) ginger and something of cod oil. A salty note. But claiming this is completely unpeated, seems a bit off the mark. Could it be residue in the pipes? I do get an unmistakable peaty tang on the nose – which is very good, by the way.The finish is medium long, mineral and waxy and – surprise! – quite smoky. It dies a mildly bitter death."
7008,Hazelburn 10-year-old,"More on: https://tomtrinkt.blog/Light fruits such as orange, pear, grapefruit and lemon dominate the first nose. Some honey is added. Vanilla and caramel complete the rather light and fresh-looking aroma.Strong, voluminous, sweet and fresh start thanks to the 46 volume percent. Very oily, creamy mouthfeel. In addition to the bright fruit notes from the aroma to crystallize exotic fruits, such as mango and papaya added. The lemon and grapefruit make for a slightly acidic impact. A light honey note and a little milk chocolate make themselves felt. Some spice can also be perceived, which is increasingly powerful, but not too dominant.Medium long, sweet, light fruits continue to dominate and a fine spice passes the dram. Overall, very round and balanced."

7012,Hazelburn 10-year-old,"The core expression of a malt which everybody has to try, no matter the preference. Main asset here is the oakiness felt troughout with both the nose and the palate. Slightly immature, though. Needs a bit of time after opening or wee bit of water to open it up but those usual tips dont help a lot with this one. Definitely more acceptable than the 8-year old which nobody needed. Overall, good value for price. I just hope thay start making older only-oak versions on a regular basis."

Overall very light and lively in the aroma, reminiscent of white wine. Fruity and sour again in the mouth (kiwi?). In addition, an association after wax. In the finish then more on the spicy-bitter side with a little oak and coffee. In the background now more dark fruity like dark grapes. Nice Everyday Dram, which is still a bit young and rough, a few more years would have made it a little rounder and even creamier. Grade: 2+"
7017,Longrow 18-year-old,"Less peaty than usual, and the nose and mouth are far sweeter than past years. This dram is complex but tightly wound together. Nose and mouth are similar: wet wool sweater after playing in the snow; burlap, muslin curtains, silly putty, rhubarb pie, very slight caramel, wet sand, white pepper, spices in an old fashioned dense carrot cake, molasses, sea salt, minerals that are a bit like the LB 16: paraffin, wax, clean mechanics garage, coastal brine. On the mouth only: fresh Band Aids, juniper sap, ochre. bee pollen. And bitterness on the finish that must be from the wood. It's not astringent at all but it is fairly pronounced. The peat is subtle. Not really much like a Longrow but in this case that is favorable. The poor man's LB 16. A bit flatter and less radiant but in the same vein. I often want more peat from a Springbank. This is in between a Springbank and a Longrow. I would call it a successful experiment. Glass is worth nosing after the dram is finished. Read a book for once as you enjoy this dram, why don't you? Sit in an old leather chair. Pet your dog's head occasionally. Consider burning that Cohiba you've been saving for a special occasion. This holiday season is shot anyway. There's no time like the present.-------------------------------As my bottle oxydizes, the peat is picking up steam. It's becoming more Longrow-like but in a good way. I like this one! I prefer to drink Longrow 18 2020 after first sipping the lastest IAAS in my glass (without rinsing). I can't express how well the IAAS 3 dried effluvium compliments a small pour of the Longrow 18. It's just sublime. This said, I am not a fan of rumwood with Springbank whiskies in general. I prefer the 2018 over this year's. The 2019 said it didn't have rum, but I think it did have some rum wood. The 2018 is the purist's dram, and the 2015 is even better IMO. I gave the 2018 a score of 89. I couldn't to that high on this bottle. It's the bitter note in the finish that put me off. I couldn't bump up the 2018 Longrow 18 to a 90 so I had to go with a score of 88 for this year's release. It's quite fun and entertaining and I don't regret buying two bottles.-----------------------------------------------New update: I just opened a 2018 Longrow 18. I definitely like it better than the 2020. I noticed the score is considerably lower on WB. I find that interesting. I also just opened the Cadenheads Ledaig 12 54.9. I like it better slightly than a Lagavulin 12 2017 that I have open as well. The Lag is nice but it's got this sort of mid-range bombast that is less interesting and less complex than the single cask Ledaig.-------------Update: mouth note like the smell of a grungy old used car battery (the powdery cake that collects) is bringing this one down one point after being open for many months. This 2020 is not one of my favorite 18's any longer. I'm fairly sure the rum wood ruined this for me. For me, rum wood and Longrow peat do not mix well. My favorite exotic wood for the Longrow is Madeira. Im not a big fan of the Red series. but the old Longrow Madeira is among my favorite whiskies of all time . . . so so good. Truth be told, tho, I really do prefer just an old cask strength Longrow with no sweet woods at all. Anything 16 years or older at cask strength with maybe a combination of fresh and refill bourbon casks. Maybe a marriage of casks for that. I would love to see a small batch of something like that from Springbank. Here is my ""desert island"" perfect Longrow small batch: A fresh bourbon 16 (or 15 or 14); a refill bourbon 16 or 17 year; and a double refill 18 year that is all distillery character and no wood influence much at all. All at CS. That would be incredible. My perfect desert island dram . . . . or my underground bunker dram hiding from roaming prick squads armed with glowy luciferage under the auspices of being ""humanitarians."" A last rites before the end dram . . . . Long live the Scots! Long live our unsullied DNA!"
7018,Longrow 18-year-old,"very tasty and well done, and certainly those rum casks play well -- echoes of the recent 15yo SB RW here. Unlike last year's (or was it 2018?), no hint of sulphur. Very hard to fault. drop of water doesn't go amiss, but only a little. 8/10harmonious casks, this is well put together, well matured and plainly springbankian... smoked caramel, touch of pineapple jam and prunes, good deal of dusty dunnage earth and putty (cf. 15yo SB/RW), smoked grist, rye bread, baked apple, touch of seashells, walnut oil, a little medicinal edge, double dip...arrival is mellow but it immediately bursts open with flavour. a great citrus, briny and sherbety edge gives way to a rather juicy midpalate with notable contributions from the sherry casks, slight tobacco, liquorice, dark fruit syrup, choco rum liqueurs (RBG), dunnage, and a bit of manure. finish is long and oily, a little tar, with some sea-stuff joining in (clams, oysters, shells, sand)"

As always with Longrow 18.Aromatic smoke, mineral citrus notes, creme brulee, slightly nutty, forest honeySmoky and creamy, again citrus notes, typically mineral, very pleasant, warmth and spice slowly build upThe smoke remains creamy and sweet on the palate, warming for a long time, very noble"

7024,Longrow 18-year-old,"Very mineral on the nose, mussel shells, salty maritime and, above all, dry, but over time a juicy apricot dumpling emerges, light hints of sherry, subtle sulfur, a bit earthy, dusty and nutty aromas, almond bitter and hazelnut. All aromas can be found in the taste, in the mouth first the apricot dumplings then the sherry before the whisky finishes dry and maritime accompanied the nutty aromas described. The smoke has already cleared away. A very elegant and round whisky."
7025,Longrow 18-year-old,"Had only a glass but already impressed with the profile and the quality of the dram. Its just delicious, but kinda not easy. The casks composition feels like whole and all integrated together, makes it for quite complex experience. I personaly love the cantaloupe melon note thar appears and disapears through the whole experience, presumably from the rum casks.I feel like this dram will be appreciated by experienced palate more and will be a learning experience for the beginner/intermediate drinkers. Im spoiled tonight :)Looking forward to see how this one improves with time in the bottle."
7026,Longrow 18-year-old,Much better than last year's Longrow 18. This one is a big hit! Very complex and finish is amazing.
7027,Longrow 21-year-old  Limited Release,"Sampled tonight at the Good Spirits Co. virtual tasting.This is excellent - 90s across the board from me.The nose is really unusual, with loads of coal smoke (it really is like nosing a bag of anthracite) and dirty concrete.The coal translates into the palate, which is incredibly oily.And the continuity of flavour holds on into the finish, which delivers dusty smoke for a long time.A beautifully composed and coherent, old-school dram."
7028,Longrow 21-year-old  Limited Release,The typical deliciously filthy Springbank profile with the smoke subtly in the background. Precisely balanced and elegant. Like a healthy Scottish farm girl with curves and style who knows when to shut up. Can't detect the 5% bourbon in it and yet it may be just that which makes it so special. Fantastic. No water needed.
7029,Longrow 21-year-old  Limited Release,"The aroma is closed, sweetish. Oily, coniferous - herbal motives, barnyard, dried fruits, minerality, spices, duchess. Noble tobacco shades, dusty barn, red orange and some industrial notes. The taste is sweet with bitterness. Smoky - citrus duo, light minerality, ash, shades of chocolate, spicy spices, barrel. The finish is longer than average. Spicy spices, ash, berry sourness, woody - tobacco history, pleasant bitterness. Conclusion: It seems to be not bad on the one hand, but on the other it is not very good. The aroma is closed, twisted it, twisted it this way and that, it does not want to go into dialogue, it also has no desire to develop, everything that it gave out at the first meeting, it will take all yours and then look back. Taste with a finish does not please with a palette of tastes, rather rustic for 21 years. The release of 2019 is inferior enough. Evaluation with great interference."

7032,Longrow 21-year-old  Limited Release,"Comparison between Longrow 21 (2019) and Longrow 21 (2020) In the nose, the fruits of the 2019 are more yellow and sometimes exotic. In 2020 they aren't exactly dark either, but they look tart overall. In addition, the 2019er has the typical longrow smoke, which is already relatively broken down. In addition, dirty notes from the Springbank distillery, a few herbs, as well as maritime and mineral impressions. The smoke at 2020 looks a bit stronger, darker and heavier. In addition, spices, tobacco and some herbs. Also dark wood tones and nuts. The 2019 is less fruity in the mouth than it is in the nose. Sweetness and wood notes come. Wood sugar. Not too sweet caramel. Plus the smoke. Then orange peel and grapefruit. It gets drier. The 2020 is again less tart than on the nose. The sherry notes have some acidic tones. I like the way. Then add the smoke and nuts. Towards the end there is slightly bitter oak and a little salt. Which do I find better now. Difficult. The 2019 is the lighter and more delicate of the two in comparison. The 2020 is therefore heartier. On the nose, I like the 2019 better. Somehow it looks more playful and not as dull as the 2020s. In the mouth I like the 2020s. It comes out fuller and fuller. The 2019 is a bit too flat for me. Both of them will no longer be price-performance winners, so buying a bottle is out of the question. I briefly poured myself the Longrow 18 (2017). Because of the composition, it is more in the direction of the 21er (2019). And the 18 doesn't have to hide from the 21. But on the contrary. The 18s look even stronger. So if there is another bottle from an older Longrow from the standard range, it will probably be an 18 again."
7033,Longrow 21-year-old  Limited Release,"Blender glass. I think it's really tasty and really good. But for a 21 year old Campletown at the price, something is missing. In particular, percentages and a ticking more width, but also depth. Still a very, very nice pleasure whisky.89.5 I like the nose in the Blenders very, very much. Exciting mixture of smoke, orange, a bit maritime. In any case, extremely round. I lack the depth and complexity a bit. It is so round and smells so delicious that I could smell it for hours, but unfortunately I could fall asleep with a satisfied grin. After 20 minutes a lot of the salt, maritime, sweet note of a very soft, but ripe Laga, without any lushness, whereby the smoke has taken a back seat.Wonderful profile, so soft and round, this mixture of mild, salty sweetness. Here again, the smoke is only very distant. It doesn't offer much and not in the face, but with time it does become a really strong malt.88.5 A bit of sweet, saltiness remains on the palate, but the finish is not really long for 21 years.

And that after just sniffing it for the first time. The longer you smell it, the deeper it looks. Dark chocolate, nutmeg, toasted flavors. Very dark, sweet and creamy at the same time. Plum compote, dates and figs come to mind. Juicy dark berries / jelly with some coffee and vanilla shake. Blueberries, blackberries and wild raspberries - all sugared and boiled down. Has a mystical effect. And at the same time playful and lovely. Extremely impressive!Here the smoke comes out clearly. It presents itself dry and reminiscent of ashes again. One thinks of a grooved wooden barrel or black, cracked logs after a campfire. And the berries - there they are again! The dark fruit notes are also represented here, the delicious plum compote is again combined with coffee and cream for men. Dark, gloomy, mystical and at the same time lovely, sugary, even reminiscent of dessert. Where can you find such an outstanding balance and complexity so quickly?

The aroma starts out promising with intense honey-vanilla sweetness, vegetal peatiness and unmistakably coastal/briny notes. On the palate, the mouth-warming, dry and fairly spirit-driven arrival is followed by bitter lemons, white pepper and salty peat smoke. Its youthfulness shows in the earthy, mineral but surprisingly short finish that is not very substantial.

Already appears creamy and thick in the nose. The distillery character comes through clearly, this beautiful mineral note, which is reminiscent of damp pebbles. Mild curry spices, turmeric, salt - the interplay of fruity and spiciness is what characterizes the nose of the 10yo so successfully.Creamy and pleasantly strong start. Salted mandarin slices, orange juice, pineapple pieces, applesauce. The fruitiness of curry, cardamom, pepper and the mineral note is captured. Salt water on pebble stone. Becomes chocolaty over time, nougat and toffee appear, cocoa, milk coffee. However, it does not lose its spicy fruitiness. Sounds like a long time with its fruits, spices, with its chocolate note at the end.

A light, easy going dram that has just enough complexity to keep me interested in what I'm sipping. Value (£38) : 9/10Very fresh on the nose with plenty of wonderful fruity character. Fresh mandarins, pears, pinepples and starfruit. Then I get tinned peaches and baked red apples. Plenty of sugar candies and malted cereals. I'm thinking sweet vanilla pudding as well as it has a creamy character to it. Classic Springbank minerality with wet rocks alongside a light ocean breeze. There is peat here, rather earthy and mildly. smoky. A little bit of white pepper spice and cardamom along with some mint.The mouthfeel. is creamy and viscous, very nice indeed. I get that amalgamation of fresh fruits once again, definitely more on the starfruit now followed by some fresh mandarin spritz. Even more vanilla pudding now, it is sweet but not overwhelmingly so. More cereal character. That salt and mineral note comes through once again with the faintest touch of peat smoke on the palate. White pepper increases in intensity but the spice is cut through by some toffee sweetness.Medium in length here. The peat is most evident on the finish with more of a drying smoke intertwined with that white pepper and salt. That minerality builds in intensity like wet pebbles by a lake. As the peat dies down, I get more toffee coated pineapples and pears."

Insanely delicious whisky for a standard 10 year old bottling. I'm guessing they picked particularly special casks to create a batch to launch the new design with. In simplified tasting terms, this has a similar profile to the Springbank 9 year old local barley, but perhaps with just an extra layer of subtlety (partly due to the lower strength).

7058,Springbank 12-year-old  Cask Strength,"Rich, well-balanced, complex and satisfying! This is pretty good to enjoy straight up. However, I personally recommend pouring a second dram and slowly sipping this Springbank over the course of 3 – 5 minutes to really uncover each layer. Let the whisky breathe a little for at least 3 minutes and the alcohol burn gets down to a more manageable level. This lets you get at the more nuanced “teriyaki sauce” flavours I was talking about.Well-crafted, well balanced and a robustly-flavoured dram that serves as a great introduction to the unique slight motor oil-evocative flavours of CampbeltownLink to Review: https://88bamboo.co/blogs/the-bamboo-post/springbank-12-year-old-55-4-ob-2021-batch-22In the glass, a burnished gold colour similar to pancake syrup.On the nose, a surprisingly intense and colourful bouquet that does not overwhelm the nose. The bouquet opens with a rich and strong maltiness reminiscent of McVitie’s digestive biscuits and vanilla spongecake. It develops into sweeter notes of honey, caramel and a tinge of orange peel. Malt and vanilla really takes the centre stage, with fresh orchard fruits playing a more secondary role. There is a minor component of sherried notes of raisins and preserved sour plum. The nose profile readily comes across even when the glass is held an inch away from the nose.Slight malt biscuit muskiness and a tinge of spice builds up mid-way through nosing. This is accompanied by mild smokiness (of the sort you get from parma ham) and a very light but distinctive smell of motoroil from a petrol station.Adding several drops of water causes the maltiness to subside, and somewhat brings the notes of raisins and plum into the foreground.On the palate, a moderately-rich texture with some oiliness coupled with substantial maltiness. Again, notes of digestive biscuits, some honey, and some banana topped with ice cream. This develops into mildly sweet raisins, figs and preserved sour plum. There is some brininess and minerality that cuts through the sweet fruits and maltiness in an even and balanced way, and the saltiness lingers on the tongue for a decent duration. Slight drying sensation on the back of the throat.On a second and smaller sip, I begin to somehow detect… a BBQ teriyaki sauce note? Sweetness and saltiness is combined and captured in a rich runny texture- add to that equation a component of mild smokiness and some heat - voila! Chargrilled BBQ teriyaki chicken with some burnt ends!Moving on to the finish that is long with some warming spice and some refreshing spearmint. There is also a strange but pleasant mixture of lingering umami soy-sauce – similar to Brand’s Chicken Essence, and a fading motoroil aroma.Intruged yet? You may wonder how notes of motor oil and saltiness can create a good whisky. Yet, for decades Springbank remains one of the most sought-after whiskies in whiskyland. Grab a dram to find out why!"

Hardly comparable.Back to the 15yo. 100% sherry cask maturation, the ppm figure [maybe] around 12-15. I reckon 60/40 refill/first-fill.N: Solid beginnings, more time needed as per usual. A soft sherried barley pong is all I noted.T: An unusual narrow/acute juicy arrival, strangely soft as if it’s been overly diluted or has spent 20 years in glass already. The story here however has not yet unravelled. If slightly thin/uneasy on the palate, it begins oozing through into the finish.F: And it goes on and on, oozing deliciously natural ppm’ed barley essence in an old skool way – as if it’s thought about breaking apart in the bottle already, but clearly hasn’t. How does it stay so dry without losing juiciness? I’m guessing that’s the sherry for you.C: Not sure I’ve ever tried anything so juicy and yet so ppm barley-dry. The most delicious ppm vibes too, really present without simply turning to peat smoke. Ideal whisky, and cheap as chips for under £60. With scoring ranging from 90 to 87, and feeling rather high-spirited, I’ll plump for 89 points."
7062,Springbank 15-year-old,"Somehow I knew from the start how that would turn out. I didn't want to approach these Notes negatively from the outset. So I stay neutral and factual with this hype bottle. Still, a small ""but"" in advance: I'll keep it short. An expected ""different"" smoke note. My bottle code 19/456An overall maritime impression with a distinctly different smoke that is to be expected, along with fine spicy notes. However, it remains one-dimensional. But according to its name, I think a good nose. The recognition value is certainly very high. As the fans say: ""... just a jumper"".He is strong and intense in the beginning, which is what makes him. But in my opinion not balanced enough for the 15 years. There are better 15s out there. It provides a spicy sweetness and a peppery texture. Certainly a good malt.Already in the transition this dirty, earthy, spicy, salty note comes through, which I don't like at all in the form. Some might even call it a miss grade. It certainly has a unique selling point and is loved or avoided for it. In any case, those who like him are in the majority. I'm aware. I respect that. Thanks for the sample. But it doesn't make it onto my shelf. I have better ideas there."

Slightly dry. Great stuff!Very delicate! Not so Woody as the nose may suggest. Dry sherry notes as well as some sweet, light Bourbon influences. Very well rounded and perfectly balanced.

7065,Springbank 15-year-old,A masterclass of brine and sherry casks delivering an old school whisky experience. Oddly enough i had a bottle of the 15yo about 6 years ago and was greatly disappointed by it and it may have been my least favourite SB thus far. This one is definitely different.

7067,Springbank 15-year-old,"A springbank totally in the nails, the influence of the casks goes wonderfully well with the heavy and smoked style of the house.  I would say that this whisky has become a must.  www.passionduwhisky.comNose: The influence of the sherry cask is present, bringing ripe fruit, roundness. Everything is fat and promises a lot of fun. The smoke and soot style of Springbank is here a little camouflaged, participates in all, but more discreetly. Slowly, lemon and ginger appear. Orange pulling on marmalade.Palate: Quite the opposite of the nose, it nevertheless has more spices. This says the fruity that includes both sweet and tangy fruits persists. Sherry influences this mouth with chocolate, notes of toast and fig. The soot thickens crescendo. Some dried fruits, hazelnuts.Final: The heavy peat is fully installed and oily. There is this bitterness from citrus fruit, from their skin. Small acidulous reminders, lemon juice."
7068,Springbank 15-year-old,"Nose: Rich and very fruity with lots of sherry tones to tempt you on the nose, Raisins chocolate and winter fruit cake mingle with the softest sweet smoke that grows in the glass. Palate: Again the sherry cask has worked it's magic on this years vintage, Rich complexity arrives across the whole palate with Toffee apples rich fondant's with orange and sweet spices. Coco dusted soft sweets, warming gentle smoke and cherries.Finish: Long lingering elegance in a bottle. If you wanted a desert island dram then this is it.

7071,Springbank 21-year-old,"Springbank 21 from 2020. The price has hardly changed compared to previous years. Unfortunately, the (wholesale) dealers play their own game and charge absurd prices! UK price = £ 190! Price in DE = 219 €! Unfortunately hardly available for the price. I opened a bottle myself today and from the first impression I find it very tasty! But I would not pay the prices above 260 €! Edit: The more I try, the better I find it. For me it is really very, very tasty and way too tasty for the money!"
7072,Springbank 21-year-old,"Even if the different types of casks dominate in my opinion, the typically dirty and lemony springbank character is present and wonderfully integrated for me. The selection and marriage of the different barrel types gives this bottling varied and multi-layered moments of pleasure. Tastes and I like it very much!  23/22/23/23 (91P)Deep dark rust with an orange shimmer emanates from the Premium Snifter, tough and oily ""legs"" adhere to the glass wall. Dark fruit sweetness rises heavily with a hint of caramelized sugar, oily a minimal smoky note dissolves and mixes with a handful of dry, earthy peat. Dark, velvety vineyard peach plays with old apricots and candied strawberries, sugar and hard caramel end in engine oil and tire abrasion, at the same time I am put down by extremely long and thick ""legs"" which pull their endless paths back into the glass. A pinch of salt trickles onto juicy lemon wedges, raspberries and blackberries flash, maritime echoes emerge and disappear in the same instant. The nose is extremely changeable and aromatic, I could smell this wonderful nose forever. The saliva begins to flow slowly, I'm looking forward to the first sip!The first sip wets the tongue dirty, sour fruit aromas suddenly ""contract"" the mouth, a blink of an eye later sweet peach pieces and liquid caramel stick to the palate, a few grains of salt melt on the tongue, roasted hazelnut fragments end in dark and slightly smoky wood tones. Dark chocolate crumbles on leather, liquorice and a few drops of espresso finish with a load of white pepper on the tip of the tongue and on the palate. Oily, dark, greasy and earthy, plus an intense mix of citrus fruits and sweet stone fruits ... Apricots, lemons, grapefruit, raspberries and blackberries, dried orange, raisins and currants, the variety of fruit aromas is impressive. Eucalyptus and mint, leather and creamy hazelnuts swim in the saliva slowly from the citrus aromas.The aftertaste gradually announces itself slightly bitter. Oily earth and dark fruit are still sticking to the palate, nuts are increasingly appearing. Creamy walnuts, almond slivers and roasted hazelnuts, accompanied by leather and dried tobacco, just fantastic!"
7073,Springbank 21-year-old,"The Springbank 21 with 30% bourbon, 30% rum, 25% sherry and 15% port is exceptional, but good!  You need time with this dram, otherwise the many aromas that you get into the glass cannot develop.  For me a very successful experiment by Springbank. You will be enchanted by an incredible variety of flavors that make you want more after every sip."
7074,Springbank 21-year-old,"From my point of view, a successful marriage of the different barrel types. Even if port and sherry dominate in my first impression, you will find - especially in the nose - an enormous number of flavors that coexist and that change over and over again.Sweet-fruity, sour, with blackberries and nuts, wine gum and salty liquorice. Changes again and again over time and also the distance between the nose and the glass;)Oily, strong start with pepper, a bit sweet, but then leather, earthy aromas, dark chocolate, a little caramel and salt quickly dominatelong, becoming significantly more bitter with orange jam, musty cellar, pepper, salt and dark red fruits"
7075,Springbank 21-year-old,"[October, 2020] What a ""Frankenstein concoction"" as a friend puts it - so the question is: Was this an intentional mix or did they have to balance out some too aggressive maturations as it happens often with port or rum casks? I am not afraid to buy a bottle because this release looks very interesting to explore, at least......and at last! Clearly, some of the casks matured way too aggressively and added a lot of bitter-astringent tannic notes - wood-heads might enjoy these but I prefer balanced malts over liquid woods. But the most fascinating encounter was a bold and impressive nose that vanished almost completely within five minutes of breathing, very strange. All in all an interesting dram to have from time to time but I do not ask for a second one in a row, usually.The colour is very dark at brown sherry and the nose offers a bold profile, as expected (I use a big spherical blender's glass for nosing, only). The most dominating impressions are the sherry aromas together with some substantial wooden notes while the rum is very shy and I do not get any malt- or port-induced aromas at all. This profile changes significantly upon breathing - the power of the first impressions vanishes quickly as do the sherry-induced aromas but the others do not occupy the space provided now. Instead, this nose somewhat collapses to a shy and rather unimpressive profile after about five minutes of oxidation - I had the first score at 91+points and now it is 88-points, unfortunately. Still it is fine and somewhat complex but it takes both time and trained olfactory cells to get the aromas now. This is one of the fastest ""vanishing noses"" I ever experienced, so hurry to enjoy the first sniffs right after serving...The taste is quite complex as can be expected from such a mix but the bitter wooden notes drive it out of balance, according to my taste buds (only). Heavy wood-heads might enjoy this but lovers of balanced drams should shy away unless they deliberately want to experience such wood-driven maturations. It is interesting to explore but the drinking enjoyment is somewhat limited (to me) - sometimes it tastes great but then all of a sudden the extreme tannins kill the enjoyment (again and again). As with most of these heavy wood-driven releases forget about adding water - it flattens the nice flavours further but strengthens the anyway too aggressive wooden notes.The dram arrives a little hot on the palate which turns quickly into a satisfying warmth but the coating effect is limited. Instead a significant drying-astringent feeling takes place from heavy tannins, obviously (as could be expected given the bold wooden notes in the nose). To me this is distracting, clearly. The finish is of medium length and keeps these drying-astringent moments until the very end. Coming back to my initial question: Yes, some of the rum and/or port casks matured too aggressively as to be released separately without some soothing sherry and bourbon casks added. So it is a ""Frankenstein concoction"", indeed!"
7076,Springbank 21-year-old,tasted from a dram at the commercial in campbeltown - very viscous and quite cloying initially. felt congested with quite alot going on. Not sure the cask selections worked or perhaps all very active and fighting for attention on first contact. I remember oranges and lashings of dark chocolate along with lots of raisins and dates. The sherry exerted. After an hour and a half the nose was superb. I think spending time with a bottle (despite the cadenheads price of £176) will be fun and the initial score is likely to increase
7077,Springbank 21-year-old,"Tried in the 1920s Blenders glass. Incredibly exciting change from nose to mouth. If the nose still has a lot of fruit and freshness to offer, the rather heavy and earthy aromas come into play in the mouth. No sharpness at any point. For me another fantastic 21-man springbank.With 46% it is possible to take a full nose and smell the intense, dark fruit aromas. Sweet wood provides the framework for kisch, espresso and chocolate. With more oxygen, strawberries and marzipan, sour cherries, rose hips and red fruit tea are added. In the background there are strong oak tones, damp ship planks, leather and brine. Spices also slowly come to the fore, allspice, clove and star anise. There are also associations with cognac and rum. A nose that is wonderfully complex and in this case definitely benefits from the 46%.Fresh and intense oak at the same time. Coffee notes, dark chocolate. The fruit takes a back seat. Apricot and ripe peaches mix with chocolate. Green walnut, espresso beans, Darjeeling, dried shitake mushrooms, prunes.Dry, long, dominated by the oak barrel. No bitterness, very dry."
7078,Springbank 21-year-old,"Comparison between Springbank 21yo (2015) WID: 64003, Springbank 21yo (2019) WID: 127557 and Springbank 21yo (2020) WID: 165480 Different in color. It's like that in the nose too. The 2015 is quite mineral, musty and somehow green. In addition, more yellow fruits, partly also citrus fruits. The Springbank notes are still there, but of course a bit more degraded than with more recent bottlings. The oak still looks relatively fresh. Also some wet leaves. The 2019, on the other hand, has rather red, relatively sweet berry fruits with some residual acid. Sometimes the fruits also look like caramelized. The mineral ones are rather subtle here. The Springbank notes shimmer in the background. Then add some chocolate. The 2020 is now even darker. More like plum jam. In addition, not yet completely dried tobacco leaves. Aromatic dark oak tones. One can only guess at the Springbank notes. But there is a certain filth. In the mouth of the 2015, the oak is more in command, which also brings a noticeable flavor. Such a mixture of dry and fresh wood. But at first there is only a little sweetness and the yellow fruits. Then Springbank comes through. In the end something like cold smoke and musty wood. With the 2019 it is a nice interplay between fruit, sweetness, spice and tart notes. After a certain time, the fruit, which is astonishingly lighter in the mouth than in the nose, and the sweetness less and the spicy and tart notes prevail. Not really bitter, but rather dry. A pleasant acidity and the slightly dirty notes are also in play. For me, the 2020 will not taste as balanced as the 2019. Nice sweetness and fruit at first. Then the wood effect looks a bit rough and not so elegant. For me quite blunt and uncouth. In addition, salty liquorice, dark chocolate, tobacco and wood seasoning. In the finish something of the Springbank character. So for me the 2015er is clearly the weakest of the three. I also just poured a small sip of 12 CS and diluted it with water. Even that looks fuller than the 2015 21er. Then comes the 2020. It's kind of delicious. The nose is really good. In the mouth, however, it seems a bit too clumsy and unpolished, as the oak comes across relatively quickly and leaves little space for other things. The 2019 is the most homogeneous whisky for me. Of course, it also got a lot of casualties, but that doesn't impose too much and leaves room for other things. So he is also the winner of this comparison."
7079,Springbank 21-year-old,"Yeah, the color is cool! Everyone is already going crazy, chasing the whisky and the prices are skyrocketing! But the content is what counts, not the margin!  And the content is too much. A nice attempt but simply too much of a good thing. The whisky looks a bit unbalanced and has no clear edge. Not typical for Springbank, but an attempt that is worth a maximum of 89 points for me and only after a lot of time and air!"
7080,Springbank 21-year-old,"Overall comment: scbp-5732. The fat and smoke are too heavy, the taste and flavor are slightly salty, and the defects are obvious. The wine is weak. The smoky feeling in the mouth feels a certain surprise. It would be better if there were more fruity flavors and strength to balance the oil quality in the smell and the taste of salty sauce.Smell the fragrance: The theme is the whiteness and emptiness brought by the smoke from the nose, the fatty lamb skewers, and the feeling of heavy grease. The complexity is not bad. There is a clear fruity taste of ripe pineapple against the background of fat, freshness of bonito flakes, salty aroma of minerals, and some grilled vegetables and kimchi radish in sauce. In addition to the main line, there is also a bitter western medicine cold oral liquid, wormwood. But there is no flavor that can keep up with the oiliness.Taste: strong saltiness and throughout the whole process, a lot of soy sauce roasted meat, a little pineapple, apple, barbecue sauce. The smoky sensation is moderately weak, but it is full of vitality and can be clearly perceived. In addition, there are spices such as moderate sesame pepper and mint. The wine is moderately light, which is surprising. The oily feel is medium, the flavor is salty and sauce, the overall strength is less, less sour and sweet, and the defects are quite obvious, but in terms of flavor intensity and corresponding ease of drinking, it should be a little bit away from excellent, but not too far .Aftertaste: long and salty, salt, pepper, grease, motor oil, mint."

After some time, shades of belly and old skin appeared.Dry, slightly harsh - honey comb, gray bread, paper, tannins.Medium duration, slightly alcoholic, echoing the palate, with an obvious honey flavor."
7086,The English Whisky 11-year-old,"Review from my blog More Drams Less Dram a: https://bit.ly/2YIgLnCPS: it seems somethings remove the final ""a"" in the website link or the word d r a m a, so I used a bit.ly alternative.Colour: Deep gold.Comments:This expression for me requires a bit more work to peel the layers than with the Original, but there are definitely more layers. While it’s bottled at 46% abv, I didn’t feel at first a very different mouthfeel than the Original, though sip after sip I found it to have more texture. You can taste the age difference between the two, but it’s not immediately obvious, at least for me. While writing my palate tasting notes, they were at first word for word the ones from the Original, but then I didn’t stop as I was getting deeper and deeper in the layers while there was nothing else for the Original. It’s good but I expected a bit more anyway.Citrus is quite present upfront. This is pricklier than the Original. Hints of wood polish, vanilla, some orange juice and a slice or two of ginger next of sweet soy sauce mixed with wasabi. Maybe some kind of meaty notes too.The arrival is very sweet and a bit thin once again. After a moment, some spices (a touch of ginger) come along, then almonds, citrus, caramel, milk chocolate and coffee. I retrieve the kind of chalky texture from the Original but it is less obvious. A second sip brings a bit of oranges, cigar smoke and some cracked black pepper.Citrus, orange, pepper and almonds with a warmth in the throat and on the tip of the tongue, with a good length."
7087,The English Whisky 2006  Founders Private Cellar,"Tasting Notes by Dominic Roskrow for Whisky AdvocateYou`ll struggle to find this, as it has been snapped up quickly, but if you can, don`t miss out. This whisky was originally made by Iain Henderson, is bottled at 5 years old, and marks a significant step forward for this fledgling distillery. The sappy notes have retreated and are being replaced by a wonderful sweet lemon and creamy vanilla whisky. The pinprick pepper adds a delightful dimension. 87 Points"

Young, surely, but very amusing and tasty. Reminded me, in a sense, ofCaol Ila (and that is always good news).The nose is nice and oily with some sweetness in theshape of toffee and burnt malt with even hints of tropical fruit like pineappleand papaya. Something that makes me think of ice coffee. Summer hay and apples,as well. But the peat is quite prominent. It gives it a sour touch, but itworks wonderfully. Citrus slowly shines through. Give it at least ten minutesand you will be amazed of the complexity of this nose. What a pleasantsurprise!The attack is somewhat weak, but very tasty from thestart. It starts a little less sweet than you would have expected after thenose and the peat also offers a rather big smokiness. Reminds me of a struckmatch. After the spices (which translates into ginger, cardamom and mostlyvanilla and nutmeg), it becomes nicely sweet. Mostly malty hints andbutterscotch. Midpalate the citrus reappears. Mint!The smoke fades very gently in the surprisingly longfinish. It makes room for apples and vanilla. It dies a very sweet, albeitpeppery, death with a touch of oak."

7094,The English Whisky 2007  Limited Edition,"http://www.clydesdale.se  This beautiful whisky has been on a Sassicaia barrel for almost 8 years. We have borrowed the following text from our friends at Vingruppen:  ""Sassicaia is one of the world's best and best-known wines. A revolutionary wine that turned wine development throughout Italy! The wine comes from Tenuta San Guido in Bolgheri. It was created by the marquee Mario Incisa della Rocchetta, who started experimenting with wine in the 1940s made on cabernet grapes. But it took a long time for the wine to find its proper shape. ""  We are very happy that English Whisky let us buy this barrel."
7095,The English Whisky 2007  Limited Edition,I generally dislike whisky stored on red wine casks and finishes but after tasting this in a whisky fair I immediately bought 3 bottles.

The aftertaste is light: smoke, wood, bread, fast fading sweetness (fruit, honey).  Conclusion . It's a good drink. Young, unfinished, but interesting and edible. Unobtrusive smoke, soft sweetness.

Strong, too high alcohol content and really not an enjoyable taste. After taste is very short lived. Had to add ice to it (which I never do!) and the ice takes the alcohol hit off and adds a little sweetness but not enough to recover this. £20, even at this low price it can not win me over.

Maybe a bit boring though, since there's not much here that surprises.Lots of vanilla at the start, but with a dusty mist covering it. Behind that I find Elstar apples, ripe banana and peaches. The keywords here are fruity and soft. Especially the latter I find remarkable, considering this is probably a fairly young whisky.Very crisp with a hint of chili pepper, which remains in the background throughout tasting it. Some ginger too. But also vanilla, apple and pear, combined with a (thin) layer of oak.Vanilla, pepper and grapes. Medium in length."

7179,The English Whisky Fine Single Malt English Whisky,
7180,The English Whisky Fine Single Malt English Whisky,"First of all I just want to say I am English and this is the first English whisky I’ve had so I wanted to like this.  With no fake colouring added and a slightly higher than minimum bottling strength things look promising before you open the bottle. The nose is perfectly pleasant, nothing to get too excited about but decent. Young, perhaps a bit spirity, slightly grassy, almonds, stewed fruits and very light toffee. On the palette though there is a quite an unpleasant element which I don’t pick up on the nose or even on the arrival, from mid palette to the finish though there is a note of something like a mix of unripe bananas and hairspray, it really makes this a bit of a chore to drink. Whether it's just some new make roughness which needs ironing out with more time in the cask or its some dodgy casks in the vatting, I don’t know. So while I wouldn’t buy this particular version again it has if anything made me even more interested in trying other expressions to see if they're all this bad. Would be very interested to hear what others think of it.UPDATE: I have now got round to opening my bottles of Chapter 3 (18 months old unpeated) and Chapter 14 (5 years old unpeated) and I do still pick up that hairspray like note but it is much more subtle. Chapter 14 is wonderful and Chapter 3 is great considering how young it is, I would give Chapter 3 a considerably higher score than this and that isn't even old enough to officially be called whisky. I don't often say this but I strongly advise you avoid this one, I wouldn't have another bottle of this if it was going free."

A swirl gives fat heads and fat slow legs.Comments:I tried this whisky a few months ago, from an older miniature, and I wasn’t impressed at that time. However, I must admit I’m liking it way much now. As I had some left from my previous Original miniature, I compared them, and the older one was pricklier on the nose and still very citrusy. The palate of the older one was thinner and sourer, less enjoyable. Batches differences are well known, and I hope new batches are more like the one I've just tasted. I do like this entry-level expression.The nose opens on citrus: squeezed lemon juice and orange, lots of fruits in fact (ripe bananas, green apple), not just from the citrus family. Malt notes are also present, dried hops, and a good vanilla whiff.The arrival is very sweet and a bit thin.

Hints of lemon and orange, and just the slightest trace of juniper. Pretty straightforward and by simply nosing this I wouldn't have guessed this to be cask strength.Straw and sugar barley, but then the smoke connects, with touches of bacon and black pepper in the background.

Nose: fresh sweet peat. Smoked pears, a little patchouli, orange leaves, ashes, coal smoke. A little narrow, perhaps, but pretty clean. With water: same. Elementary peat, I’d say. Mouth (neat): sweet, easy peat, akin to that very young peater that Benriach had, called Bernie’s moth or something ;-). Tends to become ashier and smokier, though. The first steeping of a very smoked lapsang souchong. With water: fine. Finish: shortish, a little fruitier. I just couldn’t quite tell you which fruits we’re talking about. Comments: indeed, it’s smoky, but I find the body a little thin. Frankly, apart from Brora and Ledaig (and Glen Garioch and Jura at times), who managed to make some really great peaters outside Islay? Should all distilleries make peated variants or not?

A waft of peat smoke in the background.Palate: Starts very soft and creamy with notes of vanilla, honey and sultana; then peppery chilli-like spice kicks in followed by caramel, toasted almonds and liquorice. Light smoke again present. Palate runs from sweet to spicy and then dry.Finish: Hot, spicy and long.

Ageing: sherry cask Nose: Fruity with dried cranberries and raspberries, also sultanas. Reminds me of shortbread with baked fruit. I also find mild spices, including pepper and some ginger. Palate: Very unusual. First of all, I have to emphasize that I don't notice the alcohol at all. A very creamy start, the whisky builds up gently and then becomes sweeter and sweeter. Grapes, pomace, olives, then the whisky changes back towards the dried fruits of the nose. In addition, a slight ginger spiciness and green pepper. Finish: medium long, the spices have disappeared again, but suddenly a lot of sweet cookie dough. Conclusion: Interesting story. The whisky always bends in a different direction and leaves me a little perplexed, but at the same time I am enthusiastic about such specimens. i like him 84/100 points (2022) www.notesofmalt.com"
7198,The English Whisky Sherry Cask  Single Cask Release,"Not at all bad - a nice surprise, and my favourite from this distillery to date.The highlight of the dram - light, sweet, creamy sherry and white pepper.Rather bland at first, improves with water.

7200,The English Whisky Smokey,"The English Smokey, 43% alc. Original bottling, St. George's Distillery. Extension: no information Nose: Vegetable and lots of peat smoke. Moss and foliage, citrus fruits and vanilla as well as a mixture of liquorice, aniseed and mustard. I also find some pinewood, thyme and green tea. The smoke is very cool, as if a little menthol resonates. Palate: First watery, then sourly sparkling, as if carbonic acid is involved. Peated soda water meets burnt caramel, some chocolate and grapefruit. In addition ash and pine wood, some thyme. Finish: Rather short, the emphasis is on the peat smoke, plus some pepper and ginger tea. Conclusion: The nose is wonderful, but I don't like the tangy mouthfeel at all. You should be able to get rid of that with significantly more barrel influence. It has potential, but this version is a bit unbalanced. 78/100 points (2022) www.notesofmalt.com"

Answer: First of all, the bowler hat or Coke was designed in Norfolk:‘Although the Coke (pronounced “cook”) is celebrated for its style now, its creation stems from something altogether more sensible: nobleman Edward Coke, younger brother of the 2nd Earl of Leicester, wanted a superior hat to that of the top hat which kept falling off his gamekeepers’ heads on the Holkham Hall estate in Norfolk. Coke wanted to create a hat that was hardy enough to protect heads from low-hanging branches and poacher attacks so on 25th August 1849, he trod the boards of Lock to place an order.A prototype was swiftly made by Lock’s chief hatmaker, Thomas Bowler, hence how it received its other more recognisable moniker. On inspection, Edward Coke tossed the hat to the floor – and proceeded to jump on it to assess its durability. It duly passed this colourful test and the bill for 12 shillings was settled. To this day the Earl of Leicester continues to purchase the hat, to which his ancestor gave his name, for his gamekeepers after they have completed one year of service’. lockhatters.co.ukAs for the cat, the Norfolk farmer’s label originally sported an English gentleman in a bowler but was considered too twee, too predictable. The cat offered a refreshing twist but has no significance to the whisky or hats or the distillery whatsoever.N: Creamy malty cocoa.T: Unbelievably vivid milky/creamy mocha and cocoa, and with a fizzy spiciness.F: The cocoa continues with some creaminess at the end.C: I’m surprised to see they are still selling the same batch from last year.

7237,Talisker 10-year-old,"Famous for its 'chili catch', Talisker 10 from the Isle of Skye is said to be 'made by the sea' - a suitable analogy. Its mineral, phenolic nose reminds of fresh, salty seawater with iodine and seaweed. A light sweetness of citrus fruits combines with restrained peatiness. The arrival is strong with a rich note of malted barley and dried fruits, leaving a peppery chili burn on the palate. A real 'afterburner' that finishes pleasantly warming, briny and spicy. The only downside is the excessive addition of artificial colorant (E150a), combined with heavy chill-filtration.RATING: 4.0/5.0 stars ≙ 87 pts → FIRST-CLASS"
7238,Talisker 10-year-old,"A very nice, lightly plated whisky with plenty of coastal notes. Value (£32) : 8/10Citrus and pears along with classic vanilla notes.

Peppery spices are quite evident with the citrus notes continuing.More peppery spice with some roasted coffee notes as well"
7239,Talisker 10-year-old,"Well, if you do not compare with the previous version, then everything is very good, all the characteristic components, balance, pitches, everything in its place, but in comparison with its predecessor looks more stark and simpler. It seems that with increasing volumes of release and the number of releases, the quality of the source material has fallen on average and this release is an attempt to withstand the brand under new conditions. It turned out approximately as if trying to ""improve"" a mediocre audio recording with an equalizer shift in all bands.Fresh, open, smoke-peat with fruit and citrus tones, raw coals of a bonfire, notes of smoked meat, new leather goods, light mineral-lemonade motives in the background, ashes.Coal, ash, dry peat, charred wood, peppery wave, light sweetness.Spicy-peat, peppery, dry, burnt biscuits, stout."
7240,Talisker 10-year-old,"Sturdy basics. To be able to complete such a complex flavor structure in 10 years and to sell it at a low price is really perfect. How did they do it? I believe this bottle of malt is a boon to all whisky drinkers. Thanks to Talisker, I hope this flavor can be passed down to future generations and benefit mankind forever.

7254,Talisker 18-year-old,"Here I am careful because this malt is exactly mine.  That's why it's hard for me to stay objective. First said: He is my best from the house of Talisker (affordable, good PLV). Always on the shelf. House whisky.The nose is nothing special but very pleasant. Normally one discovers aromas behind the smoke. Here you will discover delicate smoke behind fine aromas. That makes the difference. Lemon, oranges, vanilla .... everything. Mint leaves sprinkled with honey. Add a little toffee.Waxy, full-bodied, very soft body, ingenious! In addition sweet smoke with lively tingling on the tongue. Delicately peppery with a little wood, but in the direction of dark chocolate, preserved in espresso / mocha served warm. Everything feels sweet and dry. Perfect. A dream (for me). Island whisky.Medium to long, only slightly the typical Talisker note. Gorgeous warming and very well balanced, he goes off the stage. You can feel smoky liquorice in the outgoing log fire. What a performance. Now even tender malty pepper. Am thrilled. Refill is announced."
7255,Talisker 18-year-old,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deAn intense interplay of light smoke, fruity-sweet sherry aromas, maritime notes (salt) and floral hints is immediately present. The alcohol (45.8%) is well integrated, only a short time after pouring a slight cooling in the nose was perceptible during deeper breaths. Plenty of caramel, freshly cut grass, oranges, sweet sherry notes, red fruits (predominantly wild berries), spices, salt and oak notes complete the harmonious and elegant nose. One notices the Talisker the maturity of at least 18 years. The wild and impetuous notes of the 10-year-old are almost completely gone.The texture of the Talisker is oily and relatively soft. Full-bodied spread many red fruits (especially cherries and plums), juicy oranges, a pinch of freshly ground pepper and smoke. The smoke is now more intense to unfold and contrasts beautifully with the sweet and fruity sherry notes. Caramel, delicate hints of tropical fruit, a hint of dark chocolate, spices (thyme & rosemary) follow. A salty sea breeze lays like a thin veil over the other flavors. Very harmonious and smooth, without corners and edges.Medium to long, fruity-spicy, smoky and slightly warming. Fruity-sweet berries and citrus fruits slowly fade away after a hint of pepper. Woody-spicy notes, a touch of leather, dark chocolate and smoke take over the scepter. The salty sea breeze remains pleasantly present. On the palate lingers a slight dryness."
7256,Talisker 18-year-old,"A damn good Dram for a reasonable price these days (85 EUR for 18 years) .

7264,Talisker 30-year-old,"Enchanting Middle FingerThe new Talisker 30 Year Old, which was launched this year in a limited edition of 3,216 bottles, was bottled at cask strength. I'm a bit surprised that this is only 48.5%. But I am even more surprised with the painful price tag: more than 1,000 euros! Three years ago I bought a Talisker 30 for less than half that! In fact, for this money I can buy 3 or 4 bottles of the excellent 25-year-old. Admittedly, I didn't get a fancy box (sarcasm, anyone?). Anyway, let's leave the opulent packaging and the horrible price tag for what it is and check the liquid on it’s own merits. This had better be good.The nose is very subdued and elegant and a textbook example of what Talisker should be. Maritime notes, citrus fruit, pepper, delicate smoke. Wet wood, orange peels, a soft sea breeze and fishing nets. Shells on the beach. An oyster on a slate. Enchantingly delicious nose.The onset is mild, but certainly not weak despite the modest cask strength. Nice and oily, bittersweet on lemon and grapefruit with a tropical hint left and right, before a soft salty touch completely wraps the taste buds. A nice tantalum of wood spices, delicate smoke that warms your mouth and proves again that this is a very elegant Talisker. The Finish balances perfectly between salty maritime elements and the beautiful, almost tropical sweet fruit. This is Enjoyment with a capital E.In my introduction I wrote: This had better be good. It's not good, it's excellent, it's enchantingly delicious. But completely overpriced, obviously. It seems as if Diageo no longer wants to have this stuff tasted, but only wants it to be locked up in underground bunkers with 8-digit locks by the less ordinary mortals who do not know what to do with their money. They raise their middle finger to the real whisky lover. What a pity."
7265,Talisker 30-year-old,"Of course I had to try it, if only a sample. Overall, a very tasty talisker. Now the BUT: At the price of 1000 euros a joke. For the price I can get 2 bottles of the old 25 CS Talisker, which in my opinion are noticeably superior to this malt in terms of strength and depth. (My rating is of course only based on a sample, but it doesn't have to be more for me at the price - in this price segment a whisky has to pick me up as something ""very special"")mild and reserved; maritime notes; Seaweed; slightly mineral-earthy notes; light sweet fruit notes; some wood seasoning; delicate smokepleasantly mild start without the malt lacking power; oily; sweet fruit notes with tropical hints; maritime; slightly salty; delicately tingling wood spice; delicate smoke in the backgroundmild peppery flavor; some fruit; maritime notes; some wood; delicate smoke"
7266,Talisker 30-year-old,"Retail price: ~1000€ Disclaimer: The price did not matter for my rating!Concerning quality, this is a stunning release.It reminds me of an old, well rounded Speysider, but with the addition of subtle peat to it. Very harmonic, and the nose is exceptional good on this one.Would I recommend to buy a bottle?Definitely not!It is completely overpriced, if you consider the old 25yo CS versions or even the old 30yo bottlings from Talisker:- All of the 25 CS bottlings are still much cheaper (while being expensive of course) and depending on your preferred style might also be better than this one here.- The old 30yo version with 45,8% was and still is much cheaper than 1000€ and is qualitywise on the same level.- I haven't tried the old 30yo CS versions yet, but they are also not that expensive.The packaging on this bottling is of course fancier, and for some folks this might be very important.Anyway: In terms of drinking, this is a wonderful modern release in my opinion."

7269,Talisker 30-year-old,"Meanwhile the 2nd time in the glass. A wonderful combination of smoke and fruit. Vatting the Talisker 30y has done a really good job here, unlike some other new 30y editions like the Glengoyne 30y. The Tali 30y is super balanced and the barrel-strong 48.5% suit it perfectly! At the beginning the smoke is more present in the nosing and in the key. After the first sip and more, the bright, tropical fruits come through. There is nothing to complain about! This bottling can absolutely compete with the old high-barrel Talisker 30y, which has now achieved cult status. GREAT JOB TALISKER! I constantly fluctuate between 92-93 points. 92 points just don't do the Talisker justice in my rating system today and as a Talisker fan from the very beginning I can't avoid missing this fine malt 93 points! (IMPORTANT INFO) I completely ignored the price of 1000 €! In the meantime had a few more times in the glass. Yesterday next to top carats like a Port Ellen 1978 and the Ardbeg Lord. It is quite difficult for the Talisker 30y because it lags behind in terms of complexity. Final score on my part 92!"
7270,Talisker 30-year-old,"I've tried this when they presented it in the shop. It's simply phenomenal. Worth 1000 Euro? That's for you to decide. But the nose and palate are out of this world. I've only had 2 sips, so not enough to get tasting notes out of. However, I will remember it for a very long time!"
7271,Talisker 30-year-old,"The malt is very interesting because I haven't had Talisker in the glass that often, but it's not a highlight either.

7275,Talisker 57° North,"Peatier than the 10yo OB in the glass next to it. More straightforward and youthful, but the sea salt and pepper that mark a Talisker are around. There is some oak of the plankish sort. I feel the nose loses some of its definition with water, but the palate and body come nicely together at one or two teaspoons. With water out comes some gunpowder as well. The taste is peaty and honeyed but slightly hollow. In the finish the youth shows again, as peat lingers and sinks into my tongue and gums, but otherwise there is very little action apart from slight oiliness and a faint taste of sand. Let me guess, this is 5,7 years old? Tasted next to OB 10yo (87pts) and 2003 Distillers Edition (85). A big up to whomever had the good idea to make a 3x20cl pack of these malts. I'm at a stage in this hobby where I no longer care to buy full bottles of most entry level OBs (there's only so much time for whisky, and so _much_ whisky around), so these little bottles are much appreciated as I can still keep tabs with what's going on at that price range without having to stock much more whisky than I can or want to drink. Hey Laphroaig, make a tri-pack of 10yo, QC and Cask Str.!"
7276,Talisker 57° North,"Tasting Notes by producer;in brief… All of Talisker’s full-on vigour, with the promise of wisdom to come. In a sentence… A classic, intense Talisker that’s like looking out to sea with a storm brewing, and which becomes deeper and more approachable when water is added.Nose:Very clean and intense, with light smoke soon appearing. Creamy toffee, with pronounced fruit acidity. Hints of edible seaweed, heather blossom and a calming influence of vanilla that balances the crisp attack. Chalky and minty. In time, chocolate, then salt. The chocolate becomes slightly nuttier: like praline. Water tempers the attack and brings out a slightly oily note. Initially there's a firework/struck match edge, then more seaweed, as if you’re at the high water mark on a sandy beach. Sweet yet salty, with a savoury sharpness.Palate:Tart fruit, sweet to start, with smoke and tar abruptly exploding around the middle of the mouth. Sweet-centred, a little like liqueur chocolate, yet tempered by a savoury edge that stops things becoming too polite. Water deepens the effect and smoothes out the abrupt shift between sweet and smoke. Mouth filling, silky and complex.FinishOily, tingling with the signature pepperiness. Smoother with water."
7277,Talisker 57° North,
7278,Talisker 57° North,This talisker is unique. This bottling is named after the northern latitude where the Talisker distillery is located. 57 degrees north refers to longitude and its alcohol content of 57.0 vol. The whisky has no age statement.

7284,Talisker Dark Storm,"To answer your question directly, yes the Talisker 10 is better. The Dark Storm is a tasty whisky though, the development is just lacking. It does its thing but although being a travel retail exclusive, doesn't take you on a journey. Ground pepper and smoky bacon fill the nose, accompanied by light lemony notes. Malt, sour apple, floral, slight sherry, peat smoke, chili pepper. It also reminds me of Zubrowka, a Polish vodka flavoured with a strand of bison grass (Prefer that to any plain vodka on a side note). Straightforward nose, nothing too complex.Thin mouthfeel although a big oak and pepper explosion. Black pepper, salt, red chili's, alcohol heat, peat, campfire smoke, slight iodine. Classic coastal flavours but it gets a little harsh and doesn't develop much. Could use some water/oxidization.Medium to long. Hot, smoky and ashy finish. I can still taste this a few minutes later. After taking a deep breath a note of dark chocolate pops up, that surprised me positively."
7285,Talisker Dark Storm,"A very nice smooth whisky - very smokey and peaty, flavourful.Have taken this to a whisky tasting and everytime everyone prefers it over everything else in the room.A good one for the collection and to have on hand for guests."
7286,Talisker Dark Storm,"The Talisker Dark Storm matures in heavily charred oak barrels. This approach gives the fine drop an extremely intense intensity and gives it a lot of power. This makes the Dark Storm one of the smokiest bottlings from the Talisker Distillery.Smoke and salt, very maritime, with spicy impressions and oak, with fruity-sweet accents.Initially fruity, with notes of currant and liquorice, then a rush of smoke and spices.Long lasting and sweetly smoky with spicy oak."
7287,Talisker Dark Storm,"Easy drinking, tasty and pretty smoky NAS Talisker, not overly complex, but absolutely fine for a cold day. Nicely priced when it came out years ago in comparison to todays tags for young malts. I was not overwhelmed back then but consider it a decent dram nowadays. THe 45,8% are just fine and I am quite happy the abv is not any lower.Better than the Storm and the Skye in my opinion, but far away from the 10 and 57° North in flavour and quality . Neist Point used to be twice to tree times as much."
7288,Talisker Dark Storm,"An atypical talisker. I would probably not have recognized him blindly. It's drinkable, no question about it, but unfortunately also no flavor bombRaisins, dried fruits, a little sherry, brown cane sugar, light smoke, alcohol slightly pinches the nose, also slightly mineral and somewhat sourThe alcohol is noticeable, here a few solvents, a bit sour, raisins, brown cane sugar, very light smoke that almost disappears between the other aromasthe raisins and the caramel, as well as the cane sugar remain and at the end a few tannins"

7293,Talisker Dark Storm,"Well, the nose still knows how to please. What comes after that is rather unspectacular. 68 points.Amazingly smoky for a talisker. Not ashy, but fiery. In addition, hints of various fruits. Red apples, apricots.Quite weak in the beginning, quite smoky, slightly bitter in the aftertaste. Unfortunately, I can't really find the fruit.Mittellang, rauchig."
7294,Talisker Port Ruighe,"All in all, I like the Port Ruighe quite well, but there are clear points deductions for the finish and I think I also notice the lack of maturity. It tastes good to me, enjoyment sets in, but without enthusiasm. Tasted in 2013In the nose, I notice a soft smoke, but my brain quickly fades out. Behind it, I find a sweet, floral-fruity smell, almost like a sinful, a bit obscene woman's perfume. Somewhat hidden I find again the anise, which I rediscover in almost every Talisker and a slight reminder of the sea. But maybe that's just my imagination, because I know what I have in my glass.The taste shows me two very different impressions, on the one hand my tongue is greeted by a clear sparkling sharpness and I'm pretty sure it's not the alcohol. On the other side, the smell is confirmed with a flowery sweetness. I have associations of whole milk chocolate with chilli and candied rose petals.The finish disappoints me. A short sweetness is still there, but in the end there is only an unpleasant bitterness that I did not have in my mouth."
7295,Talisker Port Ruighe,"In intensity of departure, although clearly superior to the Tomatin 14, but not really my thing. The sour wine notes and the smoke do not go well together, I think. Out of round, patched port notes, too bitter; the DE is miles better. I wish the finish would be shorter ... it gets more and more disgusting.

7297,Talisker Port Ruighe,"Recognizable a Talisker, with the typical flavors and sharpness (which does not come from the alcohol). Partly not unlike the 10, dense in the nose but no real depth, rather thin in the mouth. The port does not seem intrusive, but rather well integrated, but without giving the young malt the appearance of maturity. Somehow tasty, but you don't miss a thing. Edit: After a few weeks in the open bottle, it becomes nice and waxy and velvety spicy, with a banana and pear on the nose, unfortunately with sulfur in the finish.very fine and sweet smoke and ash, vanilla, the red fruits of the port, greasy and fat with some smoked ham, oily and peppery with hints of caramel and barley malt, cassis and strawberry, raisins, orange, leather, soot, cherry, maritime notes with salt and iodine, cocoa, plum jam, green bell pepper, marzipan and traces of cinnamon, honeya dollop of honey, caramel and ash, smoked barley malt, then it gets hot with chilli, ginger and pepper, oak wood, slightly fruity and sweet, raisins, soot and cocoa powder, leather, oranges, cherries, espresso, tingling spices of clove and cinnamon, Vanilla, plumAsh and smoked barley malt, strong and earthy cocoa powder, light sweetness of port and dark fruits, in between clear bitterness, some oak and spices, pepper, caramel, vanilla, leather, hints of salt and oil, soot, drying out, subtle honey"
7298,Talisker Port Ruighe,"Unsurprisingly not as good as Talisker 10. Port Ruighe has less peat than Talisker 10. If you seek a strong combination of peat and sherry (well Port...), you are going to be disappointed here by both. It is like a wilder yet watered down version of Talisker 10 with some medium level sherry notes. I do not recommend buying whole bottle. Get a glass somewhere and it should be enough for a new experience.All in all Talisker 10 shines next to it. It feels like a more complex older whisky. Which it is (Port Ruighe ages for 7 to 8 years), so no problems there. And it is cheaper as well. Or go for Benromach 10 if you look for that sherry and peat in this price range. Still a much better choice.Sherry, a bit of peat.Bitter taste first, very little peat. Some sweetness and dark fruits afterwards.Some more sherry and again a bit of peat."
7299,Talisker Port Ruighe,"Bah I want to like this more, it’s just ok. The sweetness and peat somehow seam to clash instead of mingle. It’s not bad, just not good.Sweet and lightly acrid smoke, the sweetness does have a red wine vinegar, red berry hint, tomatoe juiceFruity, then peat smoke, white pepper, a touch thinShort, warm, peat and a light sweetness, a doughy bread note emerges"
7300,Talisker Port Ruighe,I do not have much to do with whisky anymore.
7301,Talisker Port Ruighe,
7302,Talisker Port Ruighe,"Talisker Port Ruighe, like Storm, is a 2013 launch. Named after the once thriving trading port on the Isle of Skye. In addition to the maritime Talisker character, storage in port wine casks ensures complexity and an intense fruit note of ripe red fruits. Without an age statement, the Talisker Port Ruighe is bottled at 45.8% ABV."
7303,Talisker Port Ruighe,"Little is said about the finish in port barrels - dryness in the aftertaste and sourness on the palate. Unlike the 10 year old, this release holds better smoke. Balances perfectly in the air!Malt, rich in peat smoke, burnt wood, gouache, noticeably alcoholic.Smoke, red berries, 6 out of 10 sweetness, ginger bitterness and pungency. In the air, honey, citruses, gouache, ripe garden fruits, and the sourness of barberry quickly gain strength.Astringent, tannin, sour, dry."
7304,Talisker Skye,"Talisker LightJust like the Port Ruighe, this Skye is another NAS bottling by Talisker. It is clearly an entry level malt, judging by the price tag. It is also a bit younger than the standard 10 Year Old. This Talisker, named after the island where the distillery is located, was meant to be the successor of the 10, but so far it looks like both will remain on the shelves, which is a good thing.The nose is rather closed and soft. The typical pepper and peat is somewhat understated, if you know what I mean. I get mostly grain cookies, citrus, vanilla and pears.On the palate, it comes a lot closer to the 10. Brine, soft peat and a lot of pepper precede the sweetness of the white fruit and the vanilla. There is even a hint o peach.The finish is medium long, sweet and spicy. The peat smoke lingers the longest.If the Talisker 10 is a scoundrel, then this is it's docile little brother. The 10 wrapped in silk. Talisker Light. Nothing wrong with it, but since they are in the same price range, I opt for the 10. Thanks for the sample, Pat."

7306,Talisker Skye,"Overall quite a flat, forgettable, but not unpleasant whisky.Mainly smoke, and very uninterestingThe redeeming part of the whisky, as the taste is not bad at all, the smoke is pleasant, but again, not a lot else going on.Again, nothing apart from the smoke, forgettable."
7307,Talisker Skye,"Beats whisky, whisky makes you remember hot sauces. It has its own uniqueness, expressed in the aftertaste.Pepper citruses, salt, phenols, smoke, smoked oranges with zest, smoked meat, dried grass.Meets sweet malt, orange zest, pepper, smoke.Nakatom fettles and envelops the throat with bright natural pepper, adding smoked orange when weakening."

7309,Talisker Skye,"Talisker Skye is the Isle of Skye's oldest distillery's ode to its contrasting landscape. Since 2015, the whisky has been produced directly on the rough sea and matured in American refill and toasted oak casks, with a slightly larger proportion of toasted casks. This gives the single malt the maritime-smoky note to get the feeling of spending a day on the coast of the Isle of Skye."

7312,Talisker Skye,"Talisker is one of my favorite drinks. There's always a lot going on in them. I ""approached"" this whisky several times, after which I decided to write about its qualities. It is good, but unremarkable compared to the other outlets of this distillery. Pretty sweet in every variant (aroma, taste, finish). It is also fruity, but with too much bitterness, which supposedly disappears in the end, but leaves that specific aftertaste. After tasting drams, I tried the 10-year-old version. And if I had done it before drinking the rated one, I would have to revise my grade considerably. Bought for a small amount of money and this is also its advantage.tender, sweet, smoky, peaty, apples, raisins, a little oak, earthyquite sweet, fruit, apples, citrus, freshly cut grass, smoke, salty breeze, seaweed, some smokelong, warming, sweet, honey-bitter, peppery end with a charred log."

Pears, oranges and bananas. Zip your lips.  Rattling things.  12 juicy thighs ride down the palate in drops. It is dark. The tealights are out. The wind.  It smells like burnt rubber. Pah orange. Purple Rain. How about mint ?! Yes ... and sequoia. Face. Black mint, vanilla is not mint. Ice cream.  Delicious. He is beautiful"
7319,Talisker Storm,
7320,Talisker Storm,"A seriously good showing from Talisker.Rather fresh and bright, with a subtle but certainly noticeable coastal influence and a few whiffs of peat. Pretty fruity (banana, mango, berries) and a fair hit of vanilla also. Finally a tinge of licorice and a slight minerality. Really good.Salty, peppery, smoky. But in moderation. Some toasted oak, nori and olive brine as well. A tinge of burnt lemon peel too. Rather oily mouthfeel, by the way.epper, vanilla and a tinge of iodine. Finally some chocolate. Long."
7321,Talisker Storm,"Is he the Talisker Sturm par excellence? ... certainly not. Even with the first impression, it can't convince me. Life is too short for these drams.I have my problem with boys. This is exactly what comes into play with this Talisker, OK, ... a grape note of the darker kind comes along. The announced smoke is less noticeable than expected. Vanilla and some furniture polish can actually hold their own.The smoke covers the spiciness and makes it look pale with a tendency to weakness, although supposedly 45.8%.? No clear taste buds want to arise, a bit weak, (watery?) ... unfortunately can't convince me, sorry.Short musty finish. Spicy, rather dry and clearly for me a less good memory of a Talisker."

7328,Tamdhu 12-year-old,"For a 12yo amazingly multi-layered and profound and complex, very nice sherry barrel aging. After uncorking, initially a bit closed and spicy oak, it opens wonderfully in the following weeks thanks to oxidation in the empty bottle and becomes really good!Sherry barrel with nuttiness, raisins and dark chocolate. In addition to the tangible sweetness, a lot of cinnamon, red Christmas apples and bitter orangescreamy and yet powerful, the 43% ABV fit well. In addition to what the nose already offered, now ripe sweet cherries and an initially clear, but later mild oak spice - simply tasty. In addition, caramel, dried fruit notes, men's chocolategood medium length, becoming drier. There is everything in it, what nose and palate promised - a really well-matured round thing"
7329,Tamdhu 12-year-old,"not a sherry bomb, by any stretch....but one of the most luxurious distillates on the market. nothing detracts from the velvety mouthfeel of cooked fruit and malt.medium long finish makes this one of my all-time favorite drams"
7330,Tamdhu 12-year-old,"If you're looking for an all-sherry-matured, affordable twelve-year-old, I would say this currently has the edge on the Glendronach 12 - at least as long as the focus is on the sherry aspect. I like the GD distillate a lot better, but recent batches have become pretty soft on the sherry. Compared to current bottlings of the GD 12, this one is darker, richer, more Oloroso-influenced and more satisfying in that regard.More wood and more dryness then in the 10-year-old. Equally centered on American-oak. Sweet grape, marzipan, citrus fruits, and clean, nutty sherry. Very resin-y, a side that the 10-y.o. doesn't display and which probably gives this one the edge.Yum! Lovely balance of sweet and sour, with just enough tart notes to keep it from turning all-out saccharine. Juicy, rich (for the strength), satisfying. A whisky to drink rather than ponder, but there's nothing wrong with that. Soft tannins toward the death.Remains sweet-and-sour and is gone as swiftly and smoothly as the palate had me suspect. Very more-ish, with only the softest veneer of dryness and light-brown cocoa powder."
7331,Tamdhu 12-year-old,"Finely balanced sherry whisky. Easy to drink.Light liquorice, anise, orange, vanilla, sweetness / honey, spices, a little cautious.Fruity after orange, cocoa and chocolate, then the oak seasoning comes and gives a lighter bitterness. Becoming drying.Medium length and dry."
7332,Tamdhu 12-year-old,"Nice clear sherry whisky. Now this release is undoubtedly one of the strongest representatives of the 12-year-old whisky, bottled at a commercial strength.Filled with hints of dried berries, pineapple, dried apricots, fresh baked goods and vanilla.Voiced, with notes of dried fruit, citrus, melon, bread and sweet pepper.Medium duration, sweetly fruity, with echoes of dried apricots, red orange, vanilla cake and oak at the very end."

Gradually follow Lübeck marzipan, spoonful of biscuits, delicate oak and a slightly jute-like florality.Wunderbach soft in the beginning. Nutty sherry notes, Lübeck marzipan, dried apricots, light dessert apples (eg Golden Delicious), delicate oak and a fine, dry florality. In the background fine spicy cinnamon, clove pepper and spoon liqueur soaked with nut liqueur.Long, wonderfully nutty, almond-toned but also heavy with dried apricot."
7335,Tamdhu 12-year-old,"Great affordable standard 12's. For my taste, the current Tamdhu 12 and 15 bottlings outperform the corresponding current GlenDronach.

7337,Tamdhu 12-year-old,
7338,Tamdhu Batch Strength,"Full-frontal sherry, but the nose betrays its age. This actually feels younger than the last batches. It's also way more vulgar and way less ""integrated"" than, say, Aberlour's A'bunadh. I would rather get that instead, or the Glengoyne CS, or two bottles of the 10- or 12-year-old Tamdhu at 43%.Hugely yeasty and just outright smothered with sherry. A thick almondy sweetness. Christmas spices, umami, autumn leaves: you get the idea. It's nice enough, like the ten or twelve-year-olds on steroids. But then comes...Without water; punchy, aggressive, just outright burning-the-top-of-your-tongue-hot. A no-go.With water: sweet sherry and sweet spirit combine into one teeth-coatingly saccharine affair. It's intense, it's nutty, it's leathery, and it's all happening right up front, without any hidden layers or depth. Good if you want a real young ex-sherry blast, or if you need something strong to still reach your numbed-down taste buds after a flight of other whiskies. But on its own, I can't imagine when I might want this.Echoes of sweet, syrupy, nutty-earthy modern seasoning sherry, some fading heat."
7339,Tamdhu Batch Strength,"Very tasty sherry whisky, of the correct cask strength, with which you can and should experiment, diluting it with a little water.Intense, breathable with sherry, nutty and malt tones. Deeper - chocolate cream, spices and old skin.Pleasantly scorching, berry, influenced by dried fruits, dried cherries, milk chocolate and tannins.Long-lasting, sweet and sour, with hints of dried fruits, dried berries, nuts, spices, menthol and cigar flavor."
7340,Tamdhu Batch Strength,"A Tamdhu in Cask Strength immediately made me interested when I saw it at my local dealer. A beautiful package and a special bottle caught my eye. Normally I always say Whiskies that have such an expensive marketing campaign are no good, but I like Tamdhu so lets see what we have here. All in all for the 60 bucks I paid for it. Definitely very solid and not just a pretty marketing gag.It's a little bit sharp at the start, but we have a very sherry, dry, sweetness hidden behind the sharp start. Followed by chocolate, cocoa, vanilla and Gingerbread. Peeling down the layers i also get dried figs, dried dark fruits and a mixture of spices. This is always accompanied by a slight mint note.Watered down it gets more chocolate, dried figs and raisinsIt tastes a bit thin on the viscosity, but still very solid. Smooth chocolate bomb, followed by ginger bread, oats, caramel, dark berries, vanilla, orange peel, old sawdust.Somewhere in the medium long range. Still strong on the chocolate and orange peel comes much more to the front this is followed by a slightly bitter but well integrated bitter oak note. I also get vanilla, honey, gingerbread, maple sirup, and caramelized sugar."
7341,Tamdhu Batch Strength,"Really very composed. Overall, wonderfully aromatic with sherry, nuts, dried apples, creamy pears and dried apricots. Followed by chocolate covered gingerbread, walnut ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream and caramel sauce.  With water: sherry tonic, ground nuts, marzipan, gingerbread, raisins, dried apricots, figs and pear pears. Reminiscent of a Swiss Schlorzifladen.Pronounced sherry tonic with raisins, dried figs, almonds, tender oak, leather and fine spices. Really beautifull! Gradually, caramelized oranges follow.  With water: sweet sherry tones, steamed tropical fruit, marzipan, gingerbread, baklava and sweet nut liqueurs.Sherry and nutty. Accompanied by raisins, oak and soft smoke."
7342,Tamdhu Batch Strength,"First tasted undiluted blind, then again with a little water. 2-3 points better with water. Heavy sherry flavor, Oloroso at its best with dates, berries, cherries, spices and dark chocolate. Barrel-heavy. Looks ""older than NAS"" as it is also very stable in the finish. Nose wins with water. On the palate too, even more fruit, the peppery taste disappears, the other spices remain. Even the exit does not lose. I call that an excellent swimmer!"
7343,Tamdhu Batch Strength,"second sample from a bottle that was uncorked about 10 months ago. Good, but not inspiring, for me less interesting than the Tamdhu 12yo. Needs a lot of water (reduction to about 48%) and time. Details as in the detailed and my impressions completely appropriate note"

Intense, slightly spicy, chocolaty with dried fruits. Maybe not quite as full as one would expect from the smell. In the finish, a nice chocolate note with light fruit aromas. It's a shame, unfortunately no more cinnamon. Unfortunately, it loses a bit of complexity and intensity here.

Nice sweet characteristic with strawberries, red grape juice, white grape juice and sweet snap cherries. The alcohol is relatively well integrated. The alcohol is already noticeable, but gives a nice counterpoint to the sweet basic character.A solid body, a little water is good for him. But it doesn't have to be. Very sweet and also a bit spicy. I would characterize the Oloroso barrels as largely first-fill, but that's purely speculative. The batch strength differs significantly from the agestatement bottlings.

7368,Tamdhu Batch Strength,"Conclusion and pictures on: https://tomtrinkt.deFruity sherry notes caress my nose tip. The high-potency alcohol content (58.5%) causes a slight cooling, but is well integrated overall. Sweet cherries, raspberries, wild berries and plums are dominant. The fruity-sweet notes are joined by nutty aromas, vanilla, dark forest honey, hints of baked pancakes and first signs of spicy oak. So far, the Tamdhu makes a fruity-fresh and pleasant multi-layered impression without being overstrained.Silky soft, the Tamdhu wets the entire mouth before the high alcohol content makes for a strong onset. On the tip of the tongue, a slight tingling sets in, while sweet sherry flavors run smoothly along the cheeks. Red groats, baked apples, raisins, plums and dark forest honey dominate the flavor. Christmas spices, caramel, walnuts and spicy oak notes complement the beautiful taste profile, which is still more on the fruity-fresh side settled. With the help of a few drops of water, the Tamdhu regains its sweetness and fruitiness without losing any noticeable strength. Thanks to the cask strength you can experiment very well with water. The palate already creates a subtle bitterness.Medium long, intense and warming. At the beginning of the finish, a light pepperiness briefly flashes before the fruity sweet sherry notes gradually fade away. Spicy oak notes, a hint of vanilla / caramel and spices / herbs are gaining dominance. Finally, a subtle dryness and bitterness on the palate."

The scent of sherry, baked apples, forest soil rises after a summer rain, dark plums. Then a pleasant mint freshness comes in.  With a few drops of water , the Tamdhu becomes full sweet. Honey, plums, sherry. Quite incredible.Comes very sweet and supple in the mouth. Here then lead the baking flavors, the sherry and honey notes a beautiful three-way conversation.

Yes, in the background, then getting stronger, then stepping discreetly into the background. Great. Sweet, full, strong, ripe.  With a little water: The characteristic goes back to sweetness. Honey, sherry, plums. Very great, full mouthfeel. Thick, caramel, almost like whisky liqueur. But you realize the power behind it.The honey sweetness with sherry and plum base remains in the end, too. Cinnamon is added, a nice spiciness. Wonderfully balanced, the Tamdhu remains present for a long time.  With a little water: A nice spiciness now complements the sweetness. For me, these are earthy dead notes, some may think of delicate oak tones. Anyway, nice, round, elegant."

Fairly simple but you can get lost in that.

Lots going on in the spirit. So liquorice. This spirit is very characterful. A nice weight and creamy with the liquorice.

It exactly matches my taste profile. Tasted at the same time with an Ardbeg 10. The Ledaig is fruity and fresh. The main notes for me are a lightly sugared grapefruit and a smoked and scorched lemon. Behind it are sweet green grapes. The earthy smoke is very reminiscent of a farm (cowshed). It is not as smoky and spicy as an Ardbeg 10, but it has a great fruit sweetness that our Ardbeg cannot deliver. In the finish, the Ledaig is not as persistent as the Ardbeg, but rather short.

Very wet and sour oak stump, moist tobacco leaf, old leather briefcase. Herbs moist and juicy, a little marinade and cloves. Moss on the wet stones. The aroma is very humid, powerful and tight. Great!Taste: marinated mushrooms, raw oak, stone, tobacco and cigars, and extinguished the fire - a bouquet that is in the first sip, very colorful! Then appears the oak bitterness and sweetness of plum and vanilla. The oily and dense taste.Aftertaste: first tart from oak and blackthorn, then the land becomes sweeter, a little smoke and embers. Old leather and tobacco leaf. Wood later, and it, along with leather and tobacco long enough shimmer. Duration, greater than the average.Conclusion: A wonderful malt! Reading the reviews about it, I thought nothing special, but I really liked it, hooked. A sort of ""Delmor 18 light."" Magnificent and harmonious aroma, balanced taste nice rolling in the finish. I can say that 10 Tobermory quite on par with the 10 th Ledaig. It's just that each has its own merits. I just love pickles, tobacco and whisky skin, well pro peat topics I generally keep quiet.

7420,Tobermory 10-year-old,"Ok, this one surprised me. I went in with low expectations, and found it to be a beautiful, complex whisky.

Very different from the 12 year old, and in my opionion slightly more complex without compromising on the deliciousness."

Faint farm notes (cows) too, and dried malts and citrus. It's all rather faint and unexpressive. Sure it has a little bit of character, but Deanston 12yo, which this reminds me a bit of, is better by far.A solid body on the tongue (46 % helps), oily and peppery. Simple and elemental. Flour-y, with a slightly gritty body. After the minuscule kiss of peat, there is not much else here except these yeasty, hay-ish notes. Uninspiring.Slightly soapy citrus and wet flour.

7428,Tobermory 12-year-old,"This whisky is to replace the Tobermory 10 and for me to say the least a total disappointment.  I wonder what whisky the other reviewers may have had in the glass. In any case, in my bottle purchased in the Netherlands, of all the flavors described, there is hardly anything to be found. According to paper, this whisky should have matured in ex-bourbon barrels and then have experienced a ripening in the Virgin Oak. Exactly on it lets close the nose, there appear but slight fresh wood notes and a little sweetness and otherwise almost nothing. Even after waiting for a quarter of an hour, there is no significant change.  Fruit notes, vanilla, cereal notes are virtually non-existent and it stays that way.  That makes me conclude that the bourbon barrels have been refilled and that they did not add much to the additive ripening of this whisky and left little traces.  In any case, I find only the poor flavors (sweet and fresh oak) from a typical Virgin Oak ripening, which are a no go for me.  In the taste, everything points to the Virgin Oak ripening. The whisky is predominantly disgustingly sweet, complemented by a subtle grain note and also a patched and discordant fresh oak emerges again.  Behind these dominant aromas you can find with a little imagination also a modest vanilla note, a little bit of citrus and something nutty with a lot of imagination. That's it.  In the mouth and on the finish, it shows a strong alcoholic sharpness, which I find unpleasant, again the sticky sweetness and a little oak.  Yes, what should one say about that?  This one-dimensional whisky is a huge disappointment to me and has in no way met my expectations.  I am even more disappointed with Tobermory's product management, which claims that after a two-year distillery revision, they celebrate the reopening with such a dubious whisky, taking the ever-improving 10s off the market.  Supplement!  Due to the high ratings given here, I had some doubts about my sense of taste. After bravely trying to find access to this whisky, my judgment has not changed. Interestingly, on Youtube I found a tasting video from Pat Hock about this whisky, which obviously tasted a bottle from the same batch with the same attributes and the same result. This actually indicates different batches in the market with significant differences in quality. Since everyone can now make his own judgment over it, for me, the topic Tobermory is, however, initially done."
7429,Tobermory 12-year-old,"Great nose, beautiful interplay between sweetness and spice, always accompanied by a subtle fruitiness and a very pleasant sulfur note for me. The fruit flavors are constantly changing. Sometimes plums flash, then tropical fruits like pineapple.  Also very balanced in the mouth, but not boring. Medium long, sweet and spicy finish with very pleasant tannins.Sweet, spicy, lots of malt and vanilla, cereals, nutmeg, subtle sherry, light sulfur notes, hair spray, sour cucumbers, honey, sweet plums, cloves, fresh and strong mint, pine needles, always other fruits ... plums, pineapple, lemons , strong dark chocolatesweet, pleasant spiciness, spiciness, peppermint, plums, nuts, oily, white pepper, chocolate, lots of grains, malt, honey, vanilla, changing citrus notesMedium to long, cereals, wood, vanilla, light fruitiness"
7430,Tobermory 12-year-old,"Very different from the ten-year-old it replaces. Initially I was under the assumption that some sherry casks must have been involved because this is so much rounder, sweeter, darker, and more cask-driven. Turns out I was wrong, but not completely: in contrast to the older 10 y.o., this bottling has indeed seen some ""tampering"", but not by means of ex-sherry-cask maturation. Instead, they used virgin oak for reracking (or finishing) the liquid. At any rate, the result is a success. Whereas I love me a twenty-and-up Tobermory, the regular Ten was always too yeasty and young, sour-bitter and raw for me. This, on the other hand, seems much more mature, much more well-composed and inviting. Either the two additional years of maturation have really made a difference, or the virgin oak has mellowed things out, or they've simply selected better casks. In sum, what we have here is the best of two worlds: the maritime, salty and briny Tobermory character is still very much on display, but it is counterbalanced beautifully by a rich and creamy sweetness from the oak (without becoming ""woody"" per se). Dangerously drinkable yet inherently complex. Oh, and affordable! Can we have more official bottlings like this one, please?Caramel and sea salt with a side of vegetal brine and creamy American oak. Rich, sweet, oily.Thick, chewy, lush and sweet initially. A burst of fruity acidity on the mid-palate. Then the peppery spice kicks in and carries things forward into a sour and zingy finale.Ginger and lemongrass. Medium in length and very more-ish."
7431,Tobermory 12-year-old,One of the best standards for me in 2019.  I personally like it better than its predecessor 10yo but understand even when fans say that it doesn't have the character like the 10yo.  https://youtu.be/Ks5E_Z4G96c  https://youtu.be/4Xg_JuVIlu4

Just a tinge of copper coins and plenty of minerality. Finally a whiff of honey and subtle stone fruits.Nice barley notes accompanied by pretty vibrant citrus flavours, quickly followed by a hit of oak shavings and spices — this is were the virgin oak makes its presence known. The whisky becomes slightly herbal and vegetal after.Herbal, spicy and drying. Medium in length."
7433,Tobermory 12-year-old,"This is an interesting one, but ultimately, I didn’t love it. There’s so much earth and seaside, at the expense of almost all the sweetness in the back half of the dram. I’d definitely call it unbalanced, but if those punky-wood, coastal, earthy flavours are your jam, you might dig this. It didn’t really do a whole lot for me though. I prefer the old version. If you’re finding whisky too sweet lately, give this one a go.Nose: Coastal and lightly sweet. Apple, pear, lemon, some peach, (heavily-)salted caramel, and buttery shortbread. It’s definitely earthy: there’s mud, some pine, tobacco, and maybe a whiff of rocky beach. There’s some kind of salted nuts in there as well as some malted barley. There’s a bit of a solvent-y note in here, but it comes across to me more as part of the brine rather than something obtrusive.Palate: Medium texture, slightly oily. Caramel, toffee, apple, vanilla, and nutmeg up front, before a quick development into something much earthier and dry. There’s a good dose of black pepper, the bitterness of punky (rotting) seaside wood, lots of leather, salt, and of course, salt. Very dusty, with something like bitter honey.Finish: Medium-length. A punch of woody, earthy, and dry. Salt-drenched coastal forest (much like they have on Mull, actually), clay, salt, tobacco, and herbs. Some banana, lemon, and dark chocolate, with more of that bitter honey. There’s the slightest hint of pastries wafting over."
7434,Tobermory 12-year-old,"Quick hit review.Tobermory's recent adjustment of their core range replaced the 10-year-old with this expression. Let's see what two more years can do! Sweet apricots, sage and hints of salt characterize the nose, all very fresh and fruity. On the palate, unripe peach and orange zest mingle with spicy and mineral notes.

But somehow more honest. The 12er works for me a little artificially charged.Fresh wood notes. Tree sap. Hedge trimming. Some floral notes. Sweet malt. The fruits go in the yellow direction, but seem a bit artificial to me. Also a cool and fresh touch. Anise.First sweet mixed with herbs. I'll say herbal tea with a lot of sugar candy. But then a seasoning to sharpness. In the tea you have added a fresh ginger slice and on the bite you just. Fruit muesli with light to yellow fruits (here, too, the fruits are somewhat artificial for me)Something resin. Wood notes. There is such a dryness and bitterness that I do not like. Not because of the intensity, but because of the kind."

7437,Tobermory 12-year-old,"I like it very much. Is a modern composition with a lot of wood, a lot of vanilla, a lot of fruit and again a lot of wood. The main thing is a lot of everything.

Looks very charged and wood-heavy. But still very tasty on the noseStrong, very spicy start. Slightly herbaceous and then nice and sweet. Since I had the Jaffa biscuit orange filling association, I can't get rid of it. Fruits become more intense and can be grasped slowly. Pear, tart apple and then the fruit turns into yellow juicy fruits. Again, very wood-heavy.Not excessively long but sufficient. What has been tasted and smelled so far is continued. Only the intensive wood alone becomes too much here in places and thus also monotonous."

Moonshine and basic.Cold fresh apples ""white pouring"", pears in honey, vanilla mash, sweets, Duchess drink, wood, vanilla.The taste is sweetish, soft, slightly bitter, then acidified with citruses, vodka. Some green apples and lemon, a piece of wood.Short, simple, moonshine, mash, bread and malt. Crust of white bread, bitter herbs, apples and pears, vanilla."
7440,Tomatin 12-year-old  Bourbon & Sherry Casks,"So the nose of the Legacy I liked much better, but the 12 in the mouth has the nose clearly ahead.  Notes from an online chat tasting.First of all extremely closed, I smell nothing. Now he comes slowly with pineapple, caramel and some goose notes, still extremely thin. Since I liked the nose of Legacy but much better. With heat the alcohol pokes something in the nose, otherwise hardly any change, more fermentation notes, now goes in the direction of silage, not nice! Seriously, you must not warm it!Slightly more watery than the Legacy, about the same at the start, here also herbs in front, but overall weaker than the Legacy. But more harmonic and delicate. Here, too, a bit of chocolate, to the back he is quite harsh, without the acidity of legacy.Slightly longer than the Legacy and, above all, not so bitter. Now, a bit of acidity gets on the palate, but much more moderate. The 12er also warms up a bit."

7445,Tomatin 12-year-old  Bourbon & Sherry Casks,"A nice highland malt, but lacks that special something for me, a bit of sparkle is missing, could use more freshness. The profile is simple yet well-made. Part of me can’t help but think ‘blend filler’, even though it’s really nice - but there are similarly priced competitors with more character.But, my review is based on a 5cl sample, so two largeish drams, therefore take everything I say with a grain of salt.A little ethanol prickle. Sweet, solventy, spicy, malty. Very pleasant, but also almost like a blended whisky or what a non-aficionado would expect whisky to smell like. Malt, honey, nice dry oak but not too much of it. Savoury herbs. A general floral nuance as well. Adding water reveals more fruity notes: apple, banana, clementine. A green resinous note from the casks is also in there somewhere.Good mouthfeel. Very soft, with creamy malt, honey, apple, chocolate malt biscuits, cinnamon, peppercorns. Fresh spice.Nice! Chocolate malt biscuits and other sweet-malty things going on. The oak behaves really well, and overall it’s a soft, sweet, if relatively simple experience. No rough edges. Delicious apple freshness."

The fruits are very present all the same, tropical fruits especially, pineapple, banana, maracuja, coconut. Behind, it is a little forest, leafy. Rather, palm leaf. The palate is a little light, spices and pastry cream give it a little taste, but it is still insufficient. Chocolate pear, paprika and saffron, a little silky side.

Pecan? a touch of maple syrup?half a second of fresh rosé on the tip of the tongue, then fruity red wine, then chocolate, cocoa and intense (whale) nuttiness, feels strangely juicy and dry at the same time, and despite being 3% more than Legacy / 12, it is tastier but not stronger, rather thinnermedium to long, warm, cocoa, walnut, a light, tart berry note"
7450,Tomatin 14-year-old  Port Casks,"I really do not think it's that bad, it's also very easy and pretty straightforward. The slightly sprittige he somehow makes up for it, only from the port you just do not notice much. On port reminds there only the color. Due to the extremely weak nose and the too short finish I feel really hard. 79 or 80?  Have to ask the base ...  The base has decided, 79.4.  Notes from an online chat tasting.First sprinting and at least as closed as the 12er. So for the currant jam you need a lot of imagination, but some berry is there, but seems slightly artificial. Unpleasant until now I find only the alcohol that bites so that you can not smell anything. Cocoa: Check! Deep down there is also this fermented, what the others already had. So maybe there is some honey left, but alcohol really dominates everything here. When heated, it bites properly, but it's really full of honey and a few berries on top.The consistency is very thin, but he has alcohol here, too, was to be expected. Otherwise cocoa and chocolate here, maybe a little honey, fruitiness I think not, but some mint. Tannins back in tracks, but not really. I like it much better than the nose! At the second sip he gets a little bit sprightly at the finish.Hm, as you might expect, a short break. Do not even know what's going on, a bit chocolaty maybe ...  and change ...  The finish was shorter than the Legacy. So yes, he rehearses, but he has disappeared so quickly from the tongue ..."
7451,Tomatin 14-year-old  Port Casks,"A typically decent entry-level whisky. Unfortunately not more.A port fan will not be happy from the nose. With the second and third nose you can spot the port a bit. OK. But everything else also includes the red fruits, everything washed too much soft.You get the impression that he has a bit of everything but never enough of anything !? He disappoints me.Actually relatively long and very spicy / alcoholic, but with some undertones that bother me about it. Rather indefinable."
7452,Tomatin 14-year-old  Port Casks,"A very tasty and pleasing malt with good PGV.Port and red fruit. Moist earth, grape, caramel.  In the background vanilla, brandy beans and banana.  Great, interesting nose.Sweet and creamy. Again, vanilla, caramel and fruit.  In addition coffee, port and oak wort.  Increasingly dark chocolate too.Mitel long. Slightly dry. Red fruit, coffee, dark chocolate and caramel."

7454,Tomatin 14-year-old  Port Casks,"I've generally not enjoyed Port cask matured whisky in the past but I decided to take a punt with Tomatin as I've always loved all their wine cask finishes and I've not been disappointed. All I can say is Tomatin hit it on the nose calling themselves the softer side of the highlands. This is a wonderfully balanced and delicate dram that is so easy to sip. Value (£50) : 8/10It starts off with sweet fruits. I'm thinking some stewed apples, cherries and plums covered in a caramel sauce. Then I get more tart berry compote like strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. Then the spirit character comes through, there's cereal and malt. Lovely breadiness to this too. Cocoa nibs bring some depth and richness. It has a wonderful nutty aroma to it as well, I'm thinking a mixture of walnuts and pecan pie. At the end some chilli spice warms the nose.Nice and mouth coating. It's extremely well balanced with more malty cereal and ginger biscuits. Now salted caramel notes. The nuttiness remains, more walnuts now. I'm also getting a hint of creamy milk chocolate. Those sweet and sour fruits from the nose come through just enough to add an extra layer on top of the wonderful spirit. The port character is evident, but it takes nothing away from that fruity Tomatin spirit, it just adds to it.Medium to long in length and slightly drying. It continues where the palate left off with sweet berries coating a malty centre with a warming ginger and cinnamon spice. As the finish goes on, the sweet chocolate turns darker and brings more bitterness to the finish, balancing out the sweetness."
7455,Tomatin 14-year-old  Port Casks,"Strange for a portfinish. Unround nose, but interesting finish. Still kind of tasty.  About 6 months ago, I had this filling in a blank. Without concrete notes, however, the trend was the same.Red fruits, currants and grapes, artificial alcoholic sweetness and, at the same time, acidityFirst vinous, half-sweet grapes, medium cocoa chocolate, slight sharpness on the tonguePretty pleasant. Sweet and berry notes, make room for spicy wood flavors, cocoa and espresso then to the end. The finish I find the best here."
7456,Tomatin 14-year-old  Port Casks,"not my thing the drop, the bitterness and the idiosyncratic acidity of the fruit note I do not like so much, but good quality is presentherbaceous bitterness, hints of glue, berry fruity acidity, oak, clean - slightly applied aromas, smells more like red wine, because after Port, me more time in the glass vanishes the bitterness, the fruit notes are more beautiful - red plum compote with cinnamon and red wineround, soft, then come red fruits and immediately bites the alcohol in the tongue, the burning stops again and the mouth fills with fruity, sour, slightly sweet aromas, dusty oak resonatestart - spicy, cinnamon-plum, slightly alcoholic, warming, slightly bitter"
7457,Tomatin 14-year-old  Port Casks,"Maybe a side note: The cork looks very high quality and is extremely pleasant to attack.The Port wine smells already when uncorking and first pouring. The Bourbon Bar flavors are also clearer, everything is very ""heavy"" over. He reminds me a bit of the Aberlour Double Cask 16y in color and smell.Comes very strong in the mouth - rebellious on the tongue, but no trace burning. The Portfinish comes through beautifully, later some oak and then dark fruits. The second sip a really nice Rumtopf note.Medium long, the dark mix of port and fruit stays in the mouth."

7459,Tomatin 18-year-old  Oloroso Sherry Casks,"Great value at under 60 Euros. Hefty oloroso influence, with big chocolate notes and plenty of spices, yet it doesn't swamp the distillate, which shines through with pretty exotic fruit notes toward the death. If you're looking for an affordable 18-year-old with plenty of sherry, chocolate and fruits, look no further. Two thumbs up.Red fruits, blueberry pancakes (including the maple syrup), cocoa powder, chocolate mousse, spicy oak, noticeably vinous. With time, a dusty / dunnage aspect emerges. Also displays a savory side: Worcestershire or soy sauce. Not overly complex, but very flavorful, harmonious and expertly blended. Very well sherried, but not to a degree that compromises the balance.A bit sharp without water; unsure whether that's the spirit or the oak (tending toward the former). Water evens it out easily. Very malty, chocolate-y and spicy, like a cinnamon-laced chocolate-chip cookie. Beautiful late fruitiness upon swallowing, with soft notes of exotic fruits like papaya, mango and guava. I have to say I really enjoy this palate and consider it an outstanding performance for an affordable 18-year-old OB.Medium long, with a slight alcoholic tingling (bad), but also luscious, chewy, dark chocolate flavors (goooooood), roast coffee, nuts, and measured wood spices. Again: well composed."
7460,Tomatin 18-year-old  Oloroso Sherry Casks,"I liked that quite well, beautiful, well-balanced and uncomplicated malt with age for a reasonable price. That makes sense! 84 points. Depending on the shape of the day could also be at 85, somehow delicious ...  Notes from an online chat tasting.First slightly fruity sour, again slightly angegoren, in addition to malt and a little Schoki. First let it breathe. Anyway, no alcohol in the nose here! So the peace has really done him good! Lemon juice, a few peaches, the mint I have now too. Add some dry fruits and some chocolate. It gets a bit yeasty, but at the same time fuller. Lots of peach compote, barely lemon.Jo, that's whisky, finally! Nice approach, slightly oily mouthfeel, wood, dark honey, chocolate and the orange marmalade I can confirm. In the second sip now also clearly acid, which seems to come off the barrel, nicely integrated, more chocolate.Medium long to long, very warm, the sweetness goes slowly with the wood freight and leaves walnuts in the mouth. In the second sip now also some liquorice, nevertheless a little sweeter than in the first sip, nevertheless dry."
7461,Tomatin 18-year-old  Oloroso Sherry Casks,"yes - a high quality dram with good alcohol content for a standard bottling, no junk, nothing special - except especially very boring - just not my taste of style -the lemon kills me - behind it with a lot of effort I find - what I likemild oranges and citrus notes rise from a glass with a lush dram - I had to pour more because the nose is so restrained. A little malt and some oak - a touch of mint-vanilla sugar deep in the glass, the citrus notes are very dominant in the foreground, oranges form a fruity fresh frame, oranges and mint oil bring even more freshness and liveliness - even with a drop of water nothing new happens here moretypical classic Bourbon keg, lemon, lemon peel, citrus oil fill the mouth, a little bit of acidity, light vegetable bitterness and spice mixes under the acid, the otherwise wine-like sourness of Tomatin I can only find as a delicate touch - the keg is stronger. The texture is nicely smooth - perfectly integrated the alcohol is in the nose - on the palate I feel it still slightly - but I like quite well peps up the dram on something, I feel the one-sided citruslastig from the finish, I feel a littleslightly bitter, citrusy, dry, fresh oaky - in the herbal way, subtle sweetness that always remains behind the acidity of barrel and raw brandy"

Medium-Long"
7466,Tomatin 18-year-old  Oloroso Sherry Casks,"This 18-year-old version was very much to my liking. If you want a smooth easy-going, friendly older single malt, but do not want it to be boring or completely cask-driven. Well, this could be something for you. Very well composed, and I do agree that their cask selection and maturation was top-notch.At first it appears fairly quiet, but after I gave it some time, I get biscuits, sweet barley, fresh and dried apricots, honey and beer. It all has a very natural vibe to it. Then comes the sherry cask into the mix with sweet cherries, dark chocolate cream, along with a hint of leather. The whole is round, but certainly not boring, and in fact in a modest way quite complex. It is not shouting and screaming, in stead you find yourself in a warm conversation. I also find some red apples, cappuccino cream, cacao, roasted almonds, and roasted coffee beans (water) This makes it slightly softer, and the sherry influence goes more towards chocolate milk and dried figs, while there are also multigrain toast, barley, and honey.A good blonde beer. You know those you can get from a quality small scale brewer. Oh this is a very nice start. Then it evolves with more sherry influence bringing out cacao dust, cappuccino and dried figs. (water) Again, this makes it slightly softer, but that doesn’t harm the complexity, in fact it brings out new sides. There are soft raisins, toast, sunflower seeds, a mix of different kinds of muesli, and tangerines. Lovely.More of the above."

Pleasant bottle design, a great wooden stopper with carved boar. Everything looks elegant and modern. How does the bottle content turn out? I was surprised.Nose: for a start, sweetness, fruit, very intense aroma, no striking alcohol, mild, Sherry elements appear, we get a lot of dried fruit, nice cherries, raisins, dark chocolate, notes of oak and caramel begin to appear. I gave her time in a glass, let her sit in it, the effects are more and more interesting. Honey appears, it becomes slightly buttery, you can feel pralines, nuts, baked apples, oranges, dark grapes and spices, including cinnamon and ginger. I find a note of lemongrass. Complex and rich aroma changing during the time it stay in a glass.Taste: the first impact is - intense honey and raisins, further fruits, cherries, raspberries, oily and malty whisky, a dried plum appears, followed by a bit of oak, ginger and cloves. Chocolate and walnuts are still present. The initial sweetness becomes slightly dry.Finish: warming, long, chocolate-fruity, slightly dry and spicyA great and complex smell, a taste to which I cannot have any complain, finish is the right length, whisky is very well matured. Personally, I like it very much, perfect for autumn evenings, Christmas family gatherings or sipping for pure relaxation.

Small correction, the rest of the glass, I found it a bit intrusively sour, especially in the finish, 78 points.  Notes from an online chat tasting.First fresh, fruity and malty. Now also herbs and a bit gym. I'm positively surprised! Life harmonizes with something, fruity. From the nose not bad, alcohol I have not at all. Warmth brings fullness and caramel.Amazingly strong, pepper right at the front, as well as a few herbs that are even stronger behind, the cocoa I find, in addition a lot of honey, no fruit. I do not think that's overly cute either. The mouthfeel is not as watery as feared, but in the second sip there is a lot of tin.But he is quickly gone, especially harsh, hm, actually only very dry ...  No appreciable reheating.

7538,Tormore 16-year-old,"[March, 2018]  Tormore was the first ""not-open-to-the-public"" distillery I ever visited back in the mid-nineties.  I simply parked my car in the employee parking lot and strolled across the beautiful garden of this ""design-award-like"" distillery.  All of a sudden a man came over to me and asked politely what I was doing.  As usual, I prepared a nice story for such incidents upfront and told him that I once had a Tormore dram that I liked very much but I could not find a retailer in Germany that sells Tormore bottlings (what was a shameless lie even back in the nineties - but how should a scottish production man know?).  It turned out that the man was the distillery manager himself and he invited me to his office, grabbed a bottle of Tormore out of his desk and called an employee to look for the appropriate tube.  I was that astonished that I forgot to ask him to sign it but I still keep this bottle (of a standard Tormore from that time) in my cellar as a nice memory...Despite this great encounter Tormore never belonged to my favourite distilleries because its profile is completely designed to fit blenders needs (that usually are different from what single malt drinkers prefer).  Nevertheless I try a Tormore bottling from time to time and sometimes there are really nice ones.  This one was rated very high (95 points) by Jim so this is a good opportunity to check if my taste buds are charmed by this dram as well.Oops, this is a nice surprise and a very quaffable dram!  Not 95 points in my system but a solid 88.  As there are yearly releases of this 16-year old Tormore one should always check the batch number (here B1309 for September, 2013) - I am not sure if all the other tasting notes here really refer to this batch (later batches are not that good)...The colour is burnished and the texture shows a small sticky ring at the top of the glass that slowly builds fat tears with slow legs. The nose is nicely fruity both on home-grown (apples, pears) as well as exotic (oranges, guava) fruits in a delicious barley sugary and spicy wooden setting. I like this!The taste is fruity-sugary sweet and creamy/chewable. Not the most complex but really delicious.The whisky arrives warming and coating in the mouth with just minor peppery moments that are not distracting. The finish is long and adds more wooden spices that turn a little dry at the very end. Water is not needed."

Tastes, I like itCherries, oranges, malt, butter biscuits, pineapple, really nice fruity nose with subtle woody hints.Pleasantly sweet in the mouth again with some caramel, but the light wood is a bit stronger.  When swallowing then a dash of pepper, but also a great yet slightly different fruit (ripe grapefruit or so) and the oak flavor, which then also remains.Longer pleasant, light, spicy spicy, Departure."
7545,Tormore 16-year-old,"In the nose a nice mixture of fruit (peach, apricot) and seasoning (wood, sharpness).  At first pretty sweet in the mouth. Caramel. Then come again fruit (orange, tangerine), but then gradually become bitter. Now the oak starts and it gets spicier and even pleasantly spicy. The finish is then dominated by the oak. A tingle on the tongue. It's getting dry.  For the price that was a delicious malt. A rock solid thing. I like the."
7546,Tormore 16-year-old,"My tasting notes and the ones on the box seem to be of two totally different whiskies! Great to see a core range expression bottled as high as 48%. A late night dram, perfect for unwinding by the fire and taking a backseat to life. It's got nuts, it's got coffee, it's an after dinner dram. Malty, lots of malt and barley. Nutty with pecans, peanuts, roasted chestnuts, a tub of assorted nuts from Costco (unsalted). Some coffee notes in there telling me there's a good amount of sherry casks been used.Still with the notes, those roasted chestnuts are there and a couple were burnt. Still with more sherry notes, coffee, dark chocolate and some blood oranges. Malty and long, the malty character of this dram hits you in the finish. "
7547,Tormore 16-year-old,"Yeah .... a good whisky but without much personality. Nothing out of the ordinary.  At this price it's crazy.  If it had to be given a subjective note, it would be aOrange gold dress.  It is very fruity on the nose, yellow fruits, ripe melon, candied citrus, some spices of which the Cardamom is demarcated.At first, it's dry, then the roundness unfolds, candied fruits and salty / sweet dried fruits, blond tobacco.Medium final, herbaceous on bitter not very pleasant."
7548,Tullibardine 15-year-old,"The nose is really great: Preserved fruit compote with ripe pears / apples, cinnamon and lots of honey. Creamy, mild and wonderfully harmonious.First a strong spiciness, which is accompanied by a nice sweetness (forest honey). But where did the fruit from the nose suddenly go? If you leave the whisky in your mouth for a long time, you can guess it from time to time. But even without fruit, this is a pleasant to drink malt that also has enough volume at 43%.The finish is medium-long, sweet with oak spices Conclusion: The Tulibardine 15 turned out really well. The price is fair, the packaging looks great, the taste is good and the nose is a real highlight. It's just a shame that the great fruity notes from the nose can only be found to a limited extent in the taste. But that's whining on a high level."

7553,Tullibardine 15-year-old,"A largely cask-built whisky, with a distillate of no real character that you could call a slightly stronger Strathmill.There is age-rounded, mature oak here, but unfortunately it's quite planky. Caramel, dried barley, faint sawdust, white bread crust, and maize-heavy bourbon that brings some fruitiness to an otherwise monotone dram. Some eucalyptus, and after a while in the glass, stronger bourbon fruitiness.A sawdusty sweetness hits me first, then some rye flour, dry and simple maltiness, and an unfortunate boozy note lurking beneath. Vanilla, paper, grapes, cardboard. A middling distillate in heavy bourbon sauce.Much like the mouth, but the tail turns toward tin and ethanol. An empty, washed tin of peaches comes to mind."

7569,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"With its own premium nose, it does everything remarkably well for its PLV. A great malt. It makes it into my register straight away and there is a backup for the next bargain. A big thank you to the ""Little Dram"" for the great rehearsal ..What am I dreaming of now: A leaky sherry whisky barrel is rolled out of an underground warehouse and I am just walking in. The wooden storage pallet from this barrel still smells strongly sweet after the leaked delicious sherry whisky. Empty it lies on the dust-dry warehouse floor. I sit on it and enjoy the moment! Wow. Unicorn nose.So it's not the first sip but the second. Honey-like, sweet, full-bodied, creamy and full, it dresses the mouth with everything you would expect from a good sherry texture. Now also colored effervescent powder on the nose. Delicious. Then a warm, dry tension builds up. Harmonious and well balanced, it slowly lets go of the fruity and malty. During the transition it becomes dry and warm again. Very pleasant. Malt experience!In the middle of now his potential is noticeable. Filled and cozy, it pulls down and then dries off even more. But everything is very balanced and on the good side. One could say as a conclusion: A wood dust dry type and always fruity tasty. Malt experience."
7570,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"Meanwhile, this 25-year-old Tullibardine has become one of my ""quiet darlings"". One of those whiskys that gets better the more you deal with them ...The nose is sherrylastig - the second time it also reminds of the Macallan Fine Oak 18y. Basically very fruity-deep, again and again.Comes very oily and beautiful in the mouth, pleasant strong apricot fruitiness. Malt is felt, slowly comes the oak barrel. At later Tastes join the apricots also juicy oranges and always other dark fruits.At the departure one notices the 25 years. Not sharp, but deep and warm, long. Has impressed the second button already decided stronger."
7571,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"A malt for which one should take time.A sophisticated nose that takes time. All flavors are very closely interwoven. Over time, almonds and nuts come. These are accompanied by notes of blood orange and grapefruit.The first sip is creamy and oily. Dried fruits and malt dominate the first impression. Woody notes with a hint of lit chips. Thick dark honey. Hefeplätzchen.The middle-long finish shows notes of dark chocolate and candied fruits."
7572,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"Might appear well-priced for a 25-year-old OB, but I find it too mild and toned-down to represent real value. There are plenty of more accomplished and exciting bottlings within the same price bracket.Lots of grains and cereals (much as in the 20-year old) alongside well-worn wood, adding up to a supremely dusty impression. The sherry influence is mild; if there were indeed first-fill casks involved, they don't make their presence felt. Some scattered mint leaves, a whiff of herbal tea... It's pleasant enough, but fairly simple, and certainly less interesting than what I would expect of a malt of this age.Better. Still soft, but nicely savory and with a decent attack for the ABV. On the mid-palate, quite a bit of liquorice and fennel with an umami overcoat (teryaki?). More old wood coming through now, and some dark chocolate toward the end. I wouldn't call this fruity, though. What little juiciness there is comes from the sherry casks. The rest is all wood spice and dusty barley. In a word: oatmeal.Wood smoke (or charred oak), dark cocoa, tart acidity. All very okay, but obviously hampered by the low bottling strength."
7573,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"It's not bad and has some interesting notes in it. For a big bottle it is not enough. Can not say exactly why.Dusty, dry cellar where apples are stored. Peppermint. Apricot jam. White, fermented grapes. Freshly sawn dry wood.Honeydew melon. Peach. Then it gets sourer. Lime. Shower rods. The spice of the oak clothes the mouth.Dark chocolate with orange pieces."
7574,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"Amazingly easy. Raspberry bush, gooseberries, some dried mint. Raw broccoli. Campari, sand, rotten tree bark. Freshly mown grass.Mild. Light sherry, hazelnuts, butter biscuits. Distant oak, a touch of cardboard, some flour."
7575,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"Great! One of the underrated whiskys! 88 points!Very fruity. Apricots, peaches, honeydew melon and an aromatic oak. No aggressive oak, but a clear oak. Malt is to be guessed and a honey sweetness.Tobacco and oak come first. Then it gets sweet and fruity. The apricots are back. the honey sweetness is fighting against the spicy tobacco. There does not seem to be a winner. The dessert is spicy and sweet.Here the fight is gradually decided. The oak wins. The finish is long, rather dry and spicy. the sweetness fades. Coffee is spreading."
7576,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"Surprisingly pleasant silence, nothing good from Tully was waiting for, but here, already closer to the old sherry barrels flooded in the 60's than to the regular line, and the price tag is very humane; the truth is some sharpness, gnarliness breaks through places through sherry, recalling the origin of the base, but nice overall, yes.Open, dry, soft notes of processed wood, raisins, dry leaves, moist soil, light molds, fresh mushrooms.Slightly sharp, woody-earthy with notes of lemon peel, raisins, varnish, bitter bark; dried mushrooms, black pepper, sour prunes, dark beer.Soft, refreshing, notes of dark beer, caramel, raisins, prunes, cappuccinos, some fried nuts."
7577,Tullibardine 25-year-old,"Tasty nose.  The age is noticeable above all in the taste. The finish lags behind a little.  For 25 years a good price (about 135 € as of 05/17). As a big bottle, he does not make it to my shelf"

The price is right so far, but in the category there is bettery both in terms of sherry and in terms of ex-bourbon.For a ""sherry finish"" surprisingly little sherry character. Classic ex-Bourbon notes of fresh apple and vanilla predominate. A little hay. The second nose is dominated by vanilla, now creamier with a hint of cinnamon and sugar.Somewhat bland oak, apples now darker and perhaps slightly caramelized. A little monotonous.Oak remains somewhat furry on the tongue."

A pretty fruity nose. Taste is very smooth, easy, creamy, clean spirit, quite watery up front, increasingly salty, becomes very salty. Not much to say really - this is super clean and easy almost to the extent of not tasting like whisky. No oak flavours. Spirit-led flavour and it's fairly fruity smelling but neutral tasting spirit. Good though. Enjoyable, although I appreciate light and clean whiskies in a way that many people seem not to.

Nope, ‘Matured in bourbon barrels’ is stated [on the box]. Super whisky for £25 [at Sainsbury’s at time of writing]. Malt-review says: ‘Light, fruity and with plenty of sweet characteristics there’s nowt present not to dislike’. Oh, I had this before too, after a distillery visit way~way back in 2013 [76]. For where I’m at now, and where this expression is today: Scores 83 points [recommended affordable drinker]"

A bit of lemon in the back, very pleasing noseGentle yet powerful, the guy fills the palate  Ripe grapes and now light banana flavors, some butterscotch / shortbread,  light vanilla and a hint of metallic at the backMedium long finish and very present for its percentage  Beautiful drops for carefree enjoyment"
7593,Tullibardine Sovereign,"Solid malt, no excitement, no mistakes. PLV great. Surprisingly unfruitful. Can you buy if you need something straightforward, that everything tastes good.Malty and compact on the nose, sweet and some yoghurt.

7600,Widow Jane 04-year-old  Wapsie Valley,"Nose - Initially maple syrup and cherry wood. Wood moss, mushroom soup and hints of vanilla. Nutty and toast in the background.Palate - Tobacco leaf, cherry liqueur, walnuts, wood lacquer, pencil eraser. With water some crème brûlée.Finish - Medium-long. Cherry lozenge, woody and light hit of pepper.Empty glass has notes of tomato vines and stock cube. Following morning sediment in bottom of glass smells like chocolate gateau cake.Very unusual dram.

7602,Widow Jane 08-year-old  Straight Bourbon Whiskey,"Wow, very pleasant surprise. Unfortunately next to impossible to find in my neck of the woods. Next time I visit New York, I’ll have to pay them a visit. Thanks, Jan!The honeysweet nose (which starts rather closed) shows some bourbon traits, but stands out more than enough with raisins and loads of toffee, tobacco leaves and the skin of red apples. It’s even a bit candy-like. But more fruity than a lot of bourbons I have tried lately. Loads of cherries. Yes, this is very good.The mouthfeel is somewhat light, but it makes up for it taste-wise. Cherries, blood oranges, raisins, red liquorice (the candy shoe laces, you know?), a touch of mint and a single clove. Soft, sweet and very accessible. I get some new leather, green herbs and a mild bitter touch in the medium long finish. Very balanced. Spicy at the death."
7603,Widow Jane 08-year-old  Straight Bourbon Whiskey,Remarkable bourbon--definitely one of the best I have had.  Sweet but a lot of different flavours make it really interesting.
7604,Widow Jane 10-year-old,"nose: spices, vanilla, caramel mouth: caramel, vanilla, quite captivating oak, it is especially creamy, soft, feeling of crunching in the corn grain final: average, on the same scents, without much innovation, a lot of sweetness in fact."
7605,Widow Jane 10-year-old  Single Barrel,"Widow Jane 10yr Straight Bourbon N: Like a better Canadian Club, with lots of light caramel tones, except not disgusting T: Similar to the taste, light body with caramel... and then as it opens, a wonderful surprise of deep natural tobacco flavor. Like a sour, well-cured blend of ribbon-cut white burley. F: exactly like chewing tobacco, with the same kind of bitter and sharp notes like you would get chewing tobacco... sour bitter leaf tannin and nicotine spice. Really pleased by the tobacco notes this whiskey presents. Definitely does the theme well. Not one-note, but a great exploration on the theme."

7634,Rowan's Creek Straight Kentucky Bourbon,"Part of a line up with 8 different bourbon’s. From basic level to a little more advanced. This one is eight and last in my line up. This is one of those examples I’ve always wanted to try but it never came to buying a bottle. I have quite some expectations so let’s have a look.Wow okay this is different stuff! Rye is the first thing that comes to me. But also unusual flavors I do not often get in bourbon like dark chocolate, raisins and leather. Also vanilla is very present.On the palate it is silky en tremendously gentle! Probably one of the most silky bourbon’s I’ve ever had. After a while more peppery flavors appear but in a mild way tingling the front and middle of the tongue.In the finish again quite some rye influence. It is pretty damn competitive to all those classic bourbon flavors which really makes this a joy to drink. I get hints of vanilla and honey (quite standard and predictable) but also I get leather, shoe polish and some sort of industrial glue.Overall the Woodford and Eagle Rare were quite a surprise but I have to conclude that, with the FR single barrel and this Rowan’s creek bourbon, I did save the best for last in this 8 bourbon try out."
7635,Rowan's Creek Straight Kentucky Bourbon,"Nicely balanced bourbon, with some typical sweet notes and some glue and petrol-like notes. At first, the finish appears to be somewhat short, but after some time it gets much longer and better.Very sweet, vanilla, sweet corn, with also a whiff of glue and some petrol-like scent. Pretty some alcohol. Later on some sawdust.Pretty full body, without being too stinging from alcohol, pretty smooth actually. Thick structure, oily, some petrol again. Sweet, corn, vanilla, glue.Still powerful, sweet corn with now some bitter notes, and grassy. Middle long, although later on, sweet notes remain pretty long, with also some fresh wood."

Elegant and balanced first impression.Mild and sweet. Ideal alcohol strength. Pleasantly spicy grain notes, but already very well matured due to the twice as long storage time compared to the Willett 02-year-old.Light and cute. Rather short"
7646,Willett 04-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Rye,This rye is like no other. Pure candy in a bottle. I have tried other rye's and this one stands out. I cannot believe its only 4 years old.
7647,Willett 04-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Rye,"A Rye who has absolutely convinced me; I would buy again at any time!The nose is very strong and present. Dark honey, some beeswax, cocoa notes. Then strong chocolate notes. Fresh oak and some cereal sometimes flash up between the above sweet notes.Oily consistency and very strong onset, despite the few drops of water I have added. Maple syrup, chocolate, cocoa and strong spicy notes; Here, too, a very pleasant interplay between sweetness and spice.  ""Taste storms"" would be the apt term here.Long and more on the bitter side. Here comes the oak in the form of tannins and pleasant-strong bitterness to wear; sometimes a note that reminds me of apple seeds. Every now and then the honey note and the beeswax shimmers quite pale."

7649,Willett 06-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"Wheated bourbon, from what I'm hearing. It is a good one. Straight up, quality stuff. It's not earth-shattering, but this is rather delicious. Great ABV. I would expect ""California Dreaming"" to be a bit mellow but it is anything but."

7651,Willett 08-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Rye,"You would never guess this was cask strength,a shy nose, but the sweetness and subtle spice work very well on the palate, and the pop of pepper in the finish is great.Sweet and earthy, yes rye bread and honey, a good classic rye nose with no hint of 58.1abv (one I am reviewing)Smooth and sweet, rye bread with butter and honey, toffee.Pepper appears in the finish, light baking spices as well, the faintest dill/spearamint comes as the palate dries"
7652,Willett 08-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Rye,"Strong but still soft. fresh rye bread with cloves and herbs. A spicy forest honey with a slight hint of sour cherries and subtle mint.  In the finish, a pepper note is paired with it.  With 1/5 of water (to about 47-48%), the rye note becomes more dominant and drier overall.   90/100  I like it very much.  Class Rye by Willett (KBD)"
7653,Willett 08-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Rye,"These Willett's 7-8 yo ryes are all quite similar... intense, syrupy, peppery rye. Nothing really jumps out at you other than how delicious this is. You put this rye in a Manhattan, and I guarantee it will be the most delicious Manhattan cocktail you've ever had. I purchased this bottle for around $150 retail but it goes for $300-350 USD on the secondary market in the US."
7654,Willett 11-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,Gift shop bottling
7655,Willett 11-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"A wonderful WFE. Burst in your mouth drinkable, even at cask strength. Good oak, meaning it's not too oaky/bitter/off-flavored. There's nothing unique about this particular WFE, mind you, but it does everything bourbon very well."
7656,Willett 11-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"If you know Willett, you know they are a cult favorite amongst Americans, and those that know bourbons. And this cask, my friend, is a very good one. Despite a relatively high ABV, it doesn't have much burn at all... just sweet, caramelly (is that a word?) goodness with a certain dried fruit twang that is oh so enjoyable! VERY enjoyable!!!! Me likey!"
7657,Willett 12-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"Woohoo... definitely a very, very good Willett! Not much alcoholic sting on the nose, despite the high ABV, and on the palate, it's got a heavy mouthfeel and is ""creamy"" which I like a lot. Not a unique bourbon, mind you, but everything is done extremely well here. "
7658,Willett 13-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"First rate nose. Butterscotch, loads of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla. Creamy. Very even, despite obvious EtOH fumes.Very good. Quite explosive. I mean, this is 63.5% abv, so can't do nothing but explode in the palate. But there is a drinkability even at cask strength that can't be denied. An excellent bourbon. Full of caramel, cinnamon, butterscotch, done well. Good oak here.Lengthy. Lingering spiciness."
7659,Willett 13-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"A biting alcohol sting on the nose, as usual, but the palate is superb -- deep, clean, precise and very focused in its intensity, with a very tiny bit of something that I love in my bourbon or sherried single malts -- soy sauce. No off-flavors in the finish. An excellent Willett, no doubt about it. Doesn't require water, but can certainly add a few drops, but not more than that."
7660,Willett 13-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,Truly classic bourbon.
7661,Willett 13-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"Another good 81xx from Willett. More woody than the 8130 that I just had, but if you're into bourbon, that's not too much wood at all. Not as unique as some similarly aged Willett picks but this certainly hold its own against many other bourbons of similar age. A good one!!"
7662,Willett 14-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,The oak dries out the pallet on this one. I had a 11 year that was much better recently.
7663,Willett 1984  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Rye,"Known simply as ""24/94"", this 24 year old 94 proof Willett is amongst enthusiasts one of the best American bourbon/rye ever bottled. Will I be swayed by this little tid bit of fact? Let's see.Wow, a heavy and thick nose, creamy, with very obvious rye but coated with really sticky fruits, such as maraschino cherries, ripe jackfruits, a bit sourish, somewhat minty, but with no alcoholic burn at all.Wow, very viscous and heavy, probably the most I've experienced in a bourbon/rye. Almost like drinking your favorite cherry cough syrup (?!?!) with vanilla mint and menthol mixed in. Bright and lively. A hint of licorice. Beautiful rich oak. Again, so smooth with no alcoholic burn in the palate either. So much flavors packed into only 94 proof, which is VERY low for a Willett.Mouthcoating and quite long. A bit of pistachio nut at the very end. The finish usually suffers when the ABV is low, and this is no exception. The nose and palate were exceptional, but the finish is ""merely"" very good. 93.5 points. Give me another pour and I might score this a full 94 points."

7665,Willett 21-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"This is a bit predictable and a pretty straight-forward C barrel > 20 years. I can never tell if any of these are past their prime (because I am okay with oaky bourbons!), but nonetheless, they are all wonderful. I tasted this side-by-side with the wlw 2016 67.7% that came out this past year. Wlw 2016 is less oaky and also fruitier and brighter, and also a lot cheaper nowadays. As of Aug 2017, the secondary market for wlw 2016 is 600-625 and for C13D is about 900-1000 USD.A bit closed, some alcohol sting, oakBitter cherries, orange peel, loads of caramel of course, a bit of vanilla. With water, a bit of salt came out, but really, this is a caramel, oak, and bitter cherries all the way. This is not over-oaked however. I love it. Long, wonderful, but a bit of tannins and glue. "
7666,Willett 22-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"Lots of sweet cocoa in this one. Quite sweet, but not exactly fruity which I prefer. Wheated. Obvious oak, but actually may not be enough? The finish is a bit weak. This bourbon is plenty good, but I want more. "
7667,Willett 22-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"A wheated bourbon. These 20-something year old wheated Willetts command a pretty good price in the secondary market (more than $1k easy) because they are damn good, but this is an average one. A good, fresh oaky nose, but the palate is average (feels lighter than its ABV), with a comparably short finish. Mind you, I am comparing this B49 to other wheated 20yo Willett bourbons. This is still very, very good bourbon. I tried this side by side with the WLW 2016 and the WLW is better."
7668,Willett 22-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"C barrels from Willett are supposedly ""wheated"" and from the nose and taste of this one, I don't doubt it. I tasted a healthy sample of this and compared it side-by-side with the WLW 2016, and the C22D falls just a bit short of that gold standard (disclaimer: WLW 2016 is one of my all time favorite bourbons, which also happened to be wheated). The C22D is wonderful, but its nose is immediately less fruity and less ""alive"", and you can certainly taste a bit too much of the oak due to its 22 years in the barrel. The taste is also narrower, and ends a bit faster and on a bitter note compared to the WLW. With that said, this Willett is absolutely terrific. Current secondary price (June 2017) for C22D is around $900-1000 and for WLW $600. So you can say the WLW is underpriced ;). "
7669,Willett 22-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"Quite drinkable at 69.1%. It's damn good but a bit boring (or as boring as a wheated 22 yo Willett can be, I guess). Dried fruits, cinnamon, caramel. Very spicy, of course. Not enamored with the finish... short and plain. Becomes very dry when water is added."
7670,Willett 22-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"A wheated bourbon. While very good, the secondary prices for these older Willett picks are crazy. It's good, but not that good. There are plenty of bourbons available for a fraction of the cost of this. "
7671,Willett 22-year-old  Family Estate Bottled Single Barrel Bourbon,"Purchased sample. Not one of my favorites, and extremely disappointing for an older wheated Willett. Definitely would like to have another sample to compare.FYI -- will try another sample later to see if either my palate is off, or if my glass was contaminated. Crap happens. Not very bright; yup, definitely a bit closed.Ashy, coal-like, charcoal, chalk, and medicinal, definitely not what I would expect. Some burnt oak. Leather. Unique, but that might not be a good thing actually.... Weird one.Chalky finish. Weird and plasticky. Almost yucky. "

7684,Willett Pot Still Reserve  94 proof - Glass decanter,"What an awesome looking glass decanter! But does the quality of Willett Pot Still Reserve live up to the appearance of the bottle? Well, if you have a sweet tooth, you are going to love this bourbon. Sticky honey, confectionery and cheese cake dominate the nose, enriched by apricots, mild spices and hints of sage. On the palate, the rye and barley content of the mash bill becomes more obvious. Sweet and spicy flavors take turns with fresh notes of floral, leading to a satisfying, medium-length finish. Although not spectacular, this is skillfully made bourbon.RATING: 3.5/5.0 stars ≙ 84 pts → ABOVE AVERAGE"
7685,Willett Pot Still Reserve  94 proof - Glass decanter,"Amazingly fresh and fruity-sweet on the nose. In the taste tasty and pleasant; unfortunately, the finish is quite short.  Overall, a nicely made, but unspectacular bourbon.  [80 - 76 = 'really not bad' whiskey, pp ratio is totally fine]The first thing on the nose is the typical bourbon glue aroma, which however settles or evaporates over time. This is followed by a dominant and extremely strong and sweet honey note. Ripe apricots and (red) apples join the aroma. A note of cinnamon emerges behind the sweet aroma - all in all, it is reminiscent of a very sweet apple and cinnamon cake that has been glazed with honey.  ---  [in the empty glass the smell changes to a plum cake with cinnamon crumble]Very soft to the start. A mixture of rye and oak enters the palate, causing the mouth to dry out quickly; you don't notice the 47%. With the second sip, the honey sweetness comes through much better.The (light) rye aroma lingers in the mouth for a long time. Light wood tannins / spices cover the tongue. Overall, however, rather a short aftertaste."
7686,Willett Pot Still Reserve  94 proof - Glass decanter,"Very fine bourbon, comparable to best of Blanton´s Gold or equivalent single casks.Perhaps a touch more the smoothier and less spicier way."

7691,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select,"Part of a line up with 8 different bourbon’s. From basic level to a little more advanced. This one is second in my line up. And this is definitely one of the more exciting bourbons in an affordable price range! You have to like more bitterness and sourness, otherwise this might not be your dram ;)Wow this is different for bourbon terms of speaking!! This really offers another side of bourbon that I did not meet yet. It’s very fruity and even a bit floral but also rather fresh & sour and there is a musty layer to it that I can really appreciate. Apple, kiwi, mango, lime wet cardboard and caramel fudge. Interesting nose!On the palate the different side of bourbon continues by giving quite some bitter sour notes like in an unripe kiwi and green apples. Besides that, there is quite some white pepper present mid-palate. It does make this palate a bit restless but interesting at the same time.In the finish some vanilla and corn flavors try to push through but again kiwi takes over. Sour apple as well. There is some fudge and honey but it’s the world upside down. Other flavors lead the orchestra, not the usual suspects.If you expect ‘another bourbon’ you might be disappointed if you like that. This is a whole other side of bourbon and I like this a lot! In my opinion this could be appreciated much higher then it is right now."
7692,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select,"Strange bourbon, much more sour and fruity then I would expect, pretty powerful too for only 43%, and sometimes whiffs of wet cardboard pass along, in nose and taste. Only the finish is more 'standard' bourbon-like.Initially pretty sour, citrus, a lot of glue, quite some alcohol stinging. Some typical sweet corn as well now. Ripe fruits, sometimes a short whiff of wet cardboard. Sawdust.Quite powerful, pepper, with immediately a mixture of ripe fruits, wet cardboard, citrus and sweet corn. Constantly flipping from pretty nice notes to less comfortable ones.Now much more sweet, corn, honey, some citrus fruits, less alcohol pickering, a slice of bitter notes, some glue, middle long with some mouthdrying effects."
7693,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select  Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey,"This is all about menthol, peppermint and pine. A bit uninspired straight rye whiskey imho. Lacks real depth and complexity.Lots of polished oak for a start. Followed with plenty of maple syrup and toffee. Caramelized almonds. Gingerbread. I also detect blood oranges, dried apricots and raspberries. Hints of eucalyptus and some spicy rye notes at the background.Lots of pine wood now intermingled with side notes of prunes and plums. Some tobacco and anise. Also cocoa butter and fine leather. Coffee grounds and bitter chocolate. Spices of nutmeg, clove and caraway at the background.Medium long and dry. Black pepper. A little ginger. Spearmint at the end."

7696,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select  Kentucky Straight Bourbon,"Quite tannic, bitter and dry to be honest. Lacks depth and complexity.Dry with lots of woody notes. Toffee as soft fudge followed with boiled fruits of plums and pear. Hints of old leather. Menthol at the background. Reminds me of Stimorol chewing gum from my youth.Now more on bitter oranges, overripe apples and blackberries. Roasted chestnuts. Some caramel pudding as well. Truckloads of nutmeg and brown sugar. Gingerbread. Dark chocolate later on.Not that long. Cinnamon and a little white pepper. Burnt oak. Pine at the end."
7697,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select  Kentucky Straight Bourbon,"Slowly forming slow narrow legs, very slow secondary ones. Droplets. Rye and malt balance well the high corn content. Water pushes forward maltiness on the nose, sweetness on the palate, and smoothness in the finish, to the decrement of the body. A high quality full bodied bourbon: one that single malt scotch lovers might connect with.Rich, full bodied. Cereal: sweet corn, rye spice, malted barley biscuits. Wood: Old furniture, American oak. Spicy: mint, baking spices, cinnamon, nutmeg. Fruit: fresh and citrus fruits, stone fruits, berries. Earthiness: tobacco. Sweet: vanilla, maple syrup, caramel. Nuttiness: cola, hazelnut, almond, cocoa. Creamy, herbal, and floral notes. Very light smoky notes from the charred oak.Spicy on arrival: mint, pepper, clove. Develops oak, dark chocolate. Fruitiness: dry citrus, berries and stone fruits. Nuttiness. Lightly salted caramel. Spiciness on the back-palate: savory vanilla. Woody. Follows the nose, with a moderate sweetness. Herbal: slight fresh tobacco notes.Medium to long: lingering spiciness. Nuttiness: cola notes. Wood: oaky tannins. Lingering dryness and herbal notes. Light young notes. In my opinion, the finish could benefit from a higher age and a higher ABV."

I doesn't even invite me write a proper note.Shy and distant, needs some time in the glass to fully arrive. Honey, grassy, some herbs.Sweet, honey, barley, vanilla, some ginger and pineapples. In the end it feels like biting an unexpected laurel in your meal. Could be the oak.Middle-long / short, white pepper in the end before it gets leafy and bitter. The Laurel has returned."
7702,Yamazaki Distiller's Reserve  Single Malt Japanese Whisky,"Young and confused. Not one for me, especially at the inflated prices being charged for a very average dram. On a par with many £20-25 blends."
7703,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,"Appearance: Pale amber color. Nose: Malty, fruity, and very unique. Tropical fruit, with notes of coconut and pineapple, ginger snaps, toffee, vanilla, rich cookies. Crazy nose. Seems more similar to an Irish pot still whisky. Palate: Sweet and fruity flavor, soft, spicy, and malty. Dried fruits, again Irish-like, but not exactly. Finish: Sweet and spicy, hides alcohol well. With Water: Becomes sweeter and milder but not recommended generally. Overall: Very unique and delicious. I wish I had bought many when this was ¥3000 a bottle, as opposed to ¥1500 for something like half a shot. Way overpriced at Cordon Noir."
7704,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,"09/30/2019 Very exceptional with great coffee. Delicious and harmonious.Immediately on the nose, milk coffee and creamy, sweet vanilla. In addition, clear amaretto and citrus notes that become stronger over time. Some wood in the background. Very extraordinary, but very harmonious.Very strong and powerful start, sweet vanilla cream, nuts, mandarins and nice oak spice.Nutty and vanilla, tart coffee notes. The amaretto is back, with a bit bitter pear skin."

Taste: cream, wood sticks, grass, a bit of sourness, light and light flavor, diluted fruit juice Body: a little oily finish: medium , Bitter bottom, wood Overall: 80/100, not too bad, the price is about 100 yuan.

7719,Taketsuru Pure Malt,"This was really good, I must say during that whole Japanese whisky boom, I did get a little jaded especially with prices just climbing like Tesla shares. So when this came out, I was mildly hesitant, but for the price, what the hey. And that turned out to be such a good call. This was such a strong showing and I can’t rave about it enough.Some people scoff at NAS bottlings but trust me, this just took the cake. Wonderfully complex with all the right notes, it didn’t feel forced or suffered at the hands of some accelerated maturation. Yet its Japanese profile was distinctive from the nose and so nostalgic.Bottomline, light yet complex, plays all the right notes, it hits the sweet spot for most Asian palate, price is great as well. Link to review: https://88bamboo.co/blogs/the-bamboo-post/taketsuru-pure-malt-whisky-2020-release-nas​Visually, a clear light straw yellow, not very viscous. But not atypical of Japanese whiskies either.​​On the nose, it starts with a slight alcoholic tinge so I’m gonna just let it cool down a little and leave it to rest. A few minutes in, it’s certainly simmered down, the alcoholic twang is gone, thank god. It’s replaced by that characteristic musky mizunara that people like to say smells like wooden shrines. But yeah gotta give it to these marketers, it really do be smelling that way.A lot of honey as well, it’s also fruity, like green apples, apricot, blackberries. It’s very light, sweet and slightly tart buoyed by that oaky musk. Really such a great nose.​​On the palate, it’s light bodied, but oh boy does it pack a punch. At first sip it’s sweet and delicate, you do taste the honey you got on the nose, alongside this fragrant vanilla and jasmine. It’s somewhat like Pokka’s green tea. Then it develops to becoming a lot spicier and that’s where the kick is at. It grows into this little fireball that warms your throat.After that fireball simmers down, there’s this really nice soft coconut shaving, much like Ondeh Ondeh, know that desiccated coconut that coats the surface. There’s BBQ tropical fruits as well, like pineapples and pears. What’s interesting is there’s also peat which caught me by surprise. It’s a very gentle smoke that stays on after you’re done and it’s alittle salty at that. This is surprisingly very complex but so good. Like seriously, what?!​The finish is medium, it’s not too short but yet doesn’t overstay. It goes down so smooth but when that fireball is put out, all those really wonderful subtle layers come out, like that toasty coconut shavings and the grilled tropical fruits and let’s not forget that whiff of smoke that is just slightly salty. What gets you is that right after the fireball goes down and you think you’re done, man oh man, it was just intermission! There’s a full second half left!"
7720,Taketsuru Pure Malt,
7721,Taketsuru Pure Malt,Beautiful fruity nose with a few nice layers but nothing to write home about on the palate and finish.Nose: Thai lime soda next to a ripe banana and pineapple. Effervescent. Some bramble and raspberry cane. Some ripe cantaloupe. Some anise hyssop. Like an Australian sauv blanc?Palate: just vanilla and malt.Finish: lime rinds. Short. 81
